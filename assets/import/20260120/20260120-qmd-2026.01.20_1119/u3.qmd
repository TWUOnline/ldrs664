# Belonging to Others

## Overview {.unnumbered}

Building on our discussion of "belonging to ourselves" in the previous unit, in this unit we will explore the concept of "belonging to others." This key concept is foundational to the creation of authentic learning communities—spaces where students experience genuine connection with other learners, with the facilitator, and with the discipline or topics they are studying.

Unit 3 focuses on two guiding questions:

- How do we authentically belong to others?
- How do we create learning communities where students experience a sense of belonging?

### Topics {.unnumbered}

This unit is divided into the following topics:

1. Belonging to Others
2. Creating Learning Spaces Where Students Belong

### Unit Learning Outcomes {.unnumbered}

When you have completed this unit, you will be able to:

- discuss how we can authentically belong to others.
- describe elements of a learning community that create a sense of belonging.
- identify problems that affect learning communities.
- plan a learning activity that builds community.

### Learning Activities {.unnumbered}

Here is a list of learning activities that will benefit you in completing this unit. You may find it useful for planning your work.

## Belonging to Others

In *Braving the Wilderness: The Quest for True Belonging and the Courage to Stand Alone*, Brene Brown (2017) discusses the universal human need for belonging – and the importance of belonging authentically. She contrasts a true sense of "belonging" to "fitting in," which she describes as a sense of being accepted, but not as one’s true self.

> > "We want to be part of something, but we need it to be real – not conditional or fake or constantly up for negotiation. We need true belonging" (Brown,2017, p. 31)

According to Brown (2017), belonging involves a certain level of vulnerability, because it means we must show up as our true selves—and those selves often include some level of doubt or weakness or insecurity.

She defines "belonging" this way:

> > Belonging is the innate human desire to be part of something larger than us. Because this yearning is so primal, we often try to acquire it by fitting in and by seeking approval, which are not only hollow substitutes for belonging, but often barriers to it. Because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self-acceptance. (Brown, 2017, p. 32)

Part of our role as teachers and facilitators is to foster learning communities where students can truly belong.

When we belong to a group, we know that we matter to the others in the group. If we engage in discussion in class, for example, we know that our ideas will be met with respect, that we will be valued for our unique contribution to our community of learning, and that we will be accepted for who we are.

Belonging also means that we can count on others – and others can count on us. They can count on us to receive their ideas with respect, value their unique contributions to our community of learning, and accept them for who they are.

Belonging to others is not just about fitting in, as Brown (2017) argues, but being part of a group in which we know we can fully be ourselves, and others can be fully themselves, too.

### Activity: Principles for How We Treat Each Other

Estimated Time: 45 minutes

In order to create a learning community in which students know they belong to others, we must consider what it means to be part of a community – and consider practical steps we can take to create those types of communities.

Read the ["Principles for How We Treat Each Other" (Peace and Justice Institute, n.d.)](https://www.peacejusticeinstitute.org/principles/){target="_blank"} developed by the Peace and Justice Institute. They have developed 13 principles that can be practiced developing authentic learning communities. Consider how you can practice these principles in your teaching:

- Identify 2-3 specific actions you could take to incorporate these principles into your classroom environment, perhaps by sharing them with students in your class or training group.
- Choose 2-3 of the principles that resonate with you.

## Creating Learning Spaces Where Students Belong

Learning, by its nature, requires us to wrestle with ideas and facts and theoretical perspectives that are new or contradict our current knowledge or beliefs. Therefore, learning spaces must serve as spaces where we can be challenged by new ideas and challenge our current thinking, while at the same time feel confident that our thoughts and perspective are valued. These learning spaces must simultaneously allow us to be our authentic selves – and allow others to be authentic as well.

Authentic learning communities include several elements that are important if we want students to know they belong and that their voice and ideas matter.

**Speaking Authentically. Listening Deeply.**

Brene Brown (2017) discusses key concepts of creating spaces that facilitate a sense of belonging – including civility, inclusive language, truth, and respect. Often, the balance between truth and civility can be challenging – as we seek to authentically discuss new ideas – but in a manner that is both civil and respectful of others.

**Trust**

Trust is at the heart of authentic learning communities. Brown (2017) uses the acronym "BRAVING" to describe key elements of trust. These elements include Boundaries, Reliability, Accountability, Vault, Integrity, Non-Judgement, and Generosity (pp. 113-114). She argues that these elements are essential to practicing civility, and that we must know ourselves if we want to create authentic communities – whether at work or in the classroom.

Trust is an essential component of deep learning and thus must be an essential component of an authentic learning community. Palmer (2017) also argues that spaces free of fear are necessary for authentic learning. He describes a "shutdown" that occurs as we seek to protect ourselves – both teachers and students – and as we think about learning and knowing in from an either-or perspective, failing to acknowledge the great vastness of truth. Learning communities, then, must be places of trust, with a focus on learning that incorporates both "profound truth" and "paradox" (Palmer, 2017, p. 65).

**Diversity of Thought and Perspective**

We often discuss the value that diversity brings to organizations, including the value of bringing diverse perspectives and ideas to solving the challenges we face. The same is true in learning communities. An openness to ideas that challenge our thinking is foundational to learning, and thus engaging with diverse ideas and perspectives is an essential component of the learning process. Brower and Dettinger (1998) contend that diversity of thought and perspective is an essential element of a learning community. "When we define a community as a group of individuals committed to shared values and goals, who purposefully come together and work together to reach these goals, then diversity is encouraged not just for ideological reasons but also because different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds contribute to the collaborative efforts to achieve the community’s goals" (Brower & Dettinger, 1998, p. 16).

### Activity: "Ah, Not to Be Cut Off"

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

Find a quiet space in your home or outdoors. Make your favourite beverage. With your iced coffee or hot tea with honey next to you, settle into a comfortable position.

Read the poem by Rainer Maria Rilke ["Ah, not to be cut off"](https://gladdestthing.com/poems/ah-not-to-be-cut-off){target="_blank"}. Sit for a moment with this poem. Re-read it. Consider the words and ideas expressed by Rilke.

![](assets/u3/image1.png)

In your reflective journal, jot down your thoughts. Consider how you have, in your own learning experiences, experienced "the winds of homecoming" or the desire "not to be cut off."

Imagine your students entering your class on the first day. Consider how you can make them feel at home.

### Activity: BRAVING Checklist

Estimated Time: 90 minutes

Read Chapters 3-5 in *Braving the Wilderness* (Brown, 2017).

Reflect on the BRAVING checklist (p. 113-114) and write a 250-word journal entry that includes the following:

- A description of each element of the checklist, and
- A 2-3 sentence description of how you would apply this concept in a course to create an inclusive, authentic learning community.

###

### Activity: A Culture of Fear {.unnumbered}

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

Read Chapter 2, "A Culture of Fear," in *The Courage to Teach* (Palmer, 2017). As you read, consider these questions:

- How am I "at home in a universe that embraces both the smallness of ‘I’ and the vastness of all that is ‘not I,’"? (Palmer, 2017, p. 59).
- What fears do I need to overcome as a teacher so I can create space for students to express their fears?

### Activity: Scenario-Based Reflection

Estimated Time: 45 minutes

Listen to ["A Place in this Word" (3:20) (Taylor Swift, 2006)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=_FNQ5qLuLjA&list=RDAMVM_FNQ5qLuLjA){target="_blank"}.

**Consider the following scenario:**

Imagine a student in a course you are facilitating. The student submits a poorly written assignment and then does not complete the next week’s assignment. When you ask the student to meet with you, she shares this song with you and shares that she feels all alone, she doesn’t feel confident writing at an academic level, and she didn’t do this week’s assignment because she’s afraid she will fail. She thinks she probably shouldn’t have been admitted to this program.

Now, consider the same student. She submits a poorly written assignment and doesn’t complete the next assignment. You ask her how she’s doing, and she says fine. Would you respond to her differently? What questions could you ask to learn more about concerns she may be having? What statements could you make to demonstrate your support?

In your reflective journal, compose an email or talking points for a conversation with the student, specifically describing why she belongs in this course.

### Activity: Belonging Learning Activity

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

Based on the learning activities in this unit, create a learning activity you would use in a course that incorporates elements of belonging, discussed in the course readings and your Reflective Journal. Include the learning outcome for the activity, the learning activity, and a discussion of how the different elements of the learning activity would serve to support a sense of belonging for students.

Note: This activity serves as the discussion prompt for this unit. Share your response and connect with others in the Learning Community to deepen your understanding.

## Summary {.unnumbered}

In this unit, you have had the opportunity to consider concepts related to our own sense of "belonging to others" and what it means to create safe learning spaces, built on trust and an awareness that learning is both vast and paradoxical. Bringing our whole selves to the educational experience – both as teachers/facilitators and as students/learners, we must seek to authentically engage in the learning experience – and to form connections with other learners. In the next unit, we will move from the philosophical and self-reflective to explore practical strategies for creating authentic learning communities.

### Checking your Learning {.unnumbered}
