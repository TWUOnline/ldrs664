## Assignment 3: Authentic Learning Experience Design

In this assignment, you have the opportunity to integrate your personal platform of beliefs, adult learning theory, facilitator authenticity, and culturally responsive practices into the design of a learning experience for adult learners. You will demonstrate your ability to interpret theory, apply strategies, and critically reflect on how authentic learning communities can be created in real-world contexts.

### Instruction {.unnumbered}

You will design an authentic learning experience for adult learners (real or hypothetical) within an organizational setting. The design will be grounded in your personal beliefs about teaching and leadership, informed by adult learning theory, and shaped by strategies for building authentic learning communities.

Your submission will include four components:

**1. Reflective Introduction (2–3 pages)**

Present your platform of beliefs. This will include 4 5 beliefs you have regarding teaching and facilitating adult learners. Your platform can be presented in a paper format, as a concept map, a short video reflection, or in a set of visual images and annotations.

-   Explain how your authenticity as a facilitator can deepen the learning experiences of your students.
-   Explain how your beliefs relate to adult learning theory, culturally responsive teaching practices, and Indigenous ways of knowing

**2. Learning Experience Design (5–7 pages)**

Develop a detailed design for a learning experience in an organizational context.

Include:

-   2-3 learning outcomes for the learning experience you are designing. Explain how these learning outcomes align with your platform of beliefs and organizational needs.
-   A detailed description of the learning experience, including the various learning activities you will include (conversation, video, discussion about a reading. Etc.)
-   A detailed description of how you will facilitate the learning, including:
    -   one (1) specific teaching/facilitation strategy you will use to foster an authentic learning community, providing a rationale
    -   one (1) specific teaching/facilitation strategy you will use that reflects adult learning principles, providing a rationale
    -   one (1) specific teaching/facilitation strategy you will use that reflects Indigenous ways of knowing, providing a rationale
-   A detailed description of how you will measure learner engagement and the effectiveness of the learning experience.

**3. Learning Design Map (Visual Artifact)**

Create a visual representation of the process you went through to develop your platform of beliefs and design the learning experience. Through this artifact, we want to be able to see your thought process, including how you determined the beliefs that matter most to you about adult teaching and learning.

The learning artifact should illustrate:

-   How you identified what to include in your platform of beliefs, including the resources used.
-   The process you engaged in to design the adult learning experience, including the resources used.
-   The artifact can be submitted in any format you choose. Examples include a concept map, annotated diagram, infographic, or storyboard. You could make a video diary of the process, take photos of yourself at your desk thinking about your beliefs, or include a link to a LinkedIn post you wrote about the process. You can be creative here, but the goal is to make your

your thinking visible. Be sure to clearly show how you developed your platform of beliefs and how those beliefs and the theories and strategies you learned about in this course shaped your design of the learning experience. (Note: You can use AI tools to assist with visuals, but annotations and reflections must be authored by you.)

**4. Critical Reflection (2–3 pages)**

-   Analyze how the learning experience you designed demonstrates achievement of the learning outcomes for this course. (Refer to the Course Overview to refresh yourself on the course learning outcomes).
-   Reflect on how your platform of beliefs will influence your future teaching and facilitation of adult learners.
-   Identify areas in which you hope to continue to grow and learn as a teacher/facilitator, so you can create and facilitate authentic learning communities.

**Guidelines for the use of AI in this assignment**

-   You may use AI tools for brainstorming, drafting, or creating visuals.
-   All AI-assisted work must be clearly annotated or acknowledged.
-   The platform of beliefs, learning experience, and critical reflection must be authored by you. The value of this assignment lies in your human insight and application of course concepts.

### Unit 5 Discussion

#### Activity: Appreciative Interview {.unnumbered}

::: {.learning-activity time="120"}

In this discussion, you will interview a friend or colleague. Select someone who is also a coach, teacher or facilitator—or select another student. You may also choose to complete this interview with a group. By conducting an appreciative interview, you will explore strategies for creating inclusive, collaborative learning communities.

**Part 1**

Read the article, "[Appreciative Interviews (AI)"](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/5-appreciative-interviews-ai/){target="_blank"} (Liberating Structures, n.d.). As you read, you will see that these instructions are developed for groups. However, if you are conducting your interview with an individual, you may still find these instructions helpful.

Next, read "[119+ Appreciative Inquiry Interview Questions and Examples"](https://positivepsychology.com/appreciative-inquiry-questions/){target="_blank"} (Moore, 2019).

First, develop a minimum of five questions to guide the interview process. The questions should be developed based on your course learning to date, and should integrate the articles, TED talks, short films, and other resources we have reviewed together. Building on your learning, develop at least five questions that you will ask another learner, to answer the guiding questions of this unit:

-   What strategies invite students to engage in collaborative learning?
-   What strategies can you use in online learning environments to support connections between students?

**Part 2**

Then, contact your friend or colleague and schedule a time to meet, preferably face-to-face, or through zoom, skype, some other form of video conferencing, or by phone.

**Part 3**

After you have completed the interview, prepare a 250-word reflection on what you have learned from the interview, identifying at least three strategies you can use to engage students in collaborative learning as well as strategies you can use to support connections between students in online learning environments. Be sure to reference the other learner for her/his original ideas.

As you watch the video, consider: How might assumption and perceptions impact your role as an adult educator? How are adult educators servant leaders?

**Questions to Consider**

-   How are you going to live out the seven concepts of intentional practice Frett outlines? List each of the concepts and how you could live each one.
-   Reference the Silberman and Brookfield texts and find one strategy to apply to each of the seven concepts. List each concept of intentional practice and your chosen strategy beside it, include a brief description of the strategy.
-   In a general manner, explain how to use the strategies with intentionality to be a servant leader in the adult learning environment.

### Unit 8 Discussion {.unnumbered}

#### Activity: Interconnectedness and Relationship Networks {.unnumbered}

::: {.learning-activity time="150"}

Read Chapter 6, "Interconnectedness," in *Who Do We Choose to Be: Facing Reality, Claiming Leadership, Restoring Sanity* ([Wheatley, 2017](https://research-ebsco-com.twu.idm.oclc.org/plink/dc30dc3c-d319-3080-8c49-3dc07941a845){target="_blank"}).

As you read this chapter, think about Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s comment: "We exist in a bundle of life. We say, ‘A person is a person through other people.’ It is not ‘I think therefore I am’ [but rather] I am human because I belong. I participate, I share" (as cited in Wheatley, 2017, p. 223).

Based on the reading, reflect on the following questions:

-   Who has influenced you to become the person you are? Who do you depend on as ground and support for your life?
-   Demonstrate your network of relationships and annotate with the key values or wisdom you have learned from each person.
-   Because of the influence of these individuals on your values, choose two strategies from Brookfield or Silberman and show how they align with these values. (Choose strategies not previously described in your response.)

Create a concept map to show your networks of relationships using tools such as [bubbl.us](https://bubbl.us/){target="_blank"} or [popplet.com](http://popplet.com/){target="_blank"}, or on paper, take a picture and include it in your post. Reflect on how this relates to your teaching/facilitating work.

### Unit 9 Discussion {.unnumbered}

#### Activity: Reflection and Discussion {.unnumbered}

::: {.learning-activity time="75"}

As we finish this unit, let’s pause and turn inward. Self-awareness and intellectual humility are not only ideas to think about — they are also practices we can feel and live in our bodies.

**Personal Reflection (choose one):** Take 10–15 minutes to engage in a quiet activity that helps you center yourself. You might:

-   Take a short walk outdoors, noticing what comes into awareness with each step.
-   Brew a cup of tea or coffee, paying attention to the ritual of preparing and savoring it.
-   Sit quietly and take three deep breaths, noticing the rhythm of your body.
-   Sketch or doodle freely for a few minutes, letting your hand move without judgment.

As you engage in this reflective experience, hold in mind these questions:

-   Who am I becoming as an educator?
-   How can I hold both confidence and humility in this role?

**Share your insight:** After your reflection, share the following in the learning community:

-   one insight you discovered about yourself through the practice
-   how that insight might influence the contribution you want to make as an adult educator
-   a way you plan to nurture intellectual humility in your teaching or learning environment

**Engage with others:** Read the reflections of your peers. Notice what resonates with you or expands your perspective. Respond to at least two (2) peers, practicing humility by naming what you learned from their insights or how their experience challenged or enriched your own.

*Note:* This activity serves as the discussion prompt for this unit. Share your response and connect with others in the Discussion Forum in Moodle to deepen your understanding.
