We want to feel “at home” in the organizations that are part of our lives – our families, schools, communities, places of worship. We seek connection. We search for a place where we are known.\nThis sense of being “at home” is essential to our experience as learners. Deep, authentic learning happens in spaces where we feel connected with others – places and spaces where we are known. Palmer (1998) refers to this as the “spiritual quest for connectedness” (p. 5).\nIn this course, we will explore together the theoretical foundations of learning communities, evaluating key elements essential to creating authentic learning communities, where learners are known and learning is authentic. In this unit, we will engage with the writings of Parker Palmer, a teacher and writer who has written several important works regarding the essential role of authenticity in teaching and learning.\nIn addition to reading, throughout this course, we will also listen to music and view several short films that will allow us to more deeply engage with the concepts of belonging and authenticity within the teaching/learning experience.\nUnit 1 focuses on two guiding questions:",

What elements made that learning space feel like “home?”\nIn the song, *Home**, Phillip Phillips sings about the universal need we share as humans to “belong.” Take a moment now to listen to this song, considering what the lyrics say about what it means to belong.\n\nJust know you’re not alone ’Cause I’m going to make this place your home. – Phillip Phillips,\n\nWatch: Phillip Phillips - Home\n\nIn order for students to authentically learn, we must create learning spaces that are safe, where students know and feel that they belong. Palmer (1998) refers to this need for belonging as the “spiritual quest for connectedness” (p.5).\nIf a sense of belonging provides a foundation for learning, then in our role as teachers, facilitators, or coaches, we must endeavour to create spaces where students know and feel that they belong.\n\nGood teachers possess a capacity for connectedness. They are able to eave a complex web of connections among themselves, their subjects, and their students so that students can learn to weave a world for themselves. – Palmer (2017, p. 11)\n\nBut how is this done?\nIn “To Know As We Are Known,” Palmer (1993) suggests that learning spaces must include openness, boundaries, and an air of hospitality. These learning spaces, according to Palmer (1993) can be spaces “both to be and to become” (p. 71).\n\n1.3.1 Activity: Ranking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nRank the following strategies according to your comfort level. For each strategy, list one practical action you can take in an online learning environment (as facilitator or learner) to create an authentic learning space that is hospitable and open.*\n“To study with a teacher who not only speaks but listens, who not only gives answers but asks questions and welcomes our insights, who provides information and theories that do not close doors but open new ones, who encourages students to help each other learn – to study with such a teacher is to know the power of a learning space” (Palmer, 1997, pp. 70-71)\n\nSpeaking\nListening\nGiving answers\nAsking questions\nProviding information/theories that open doors\nEncouraging students to help each other learn\n\nNext, read the discussion of authentic learning environments in Herrington and Oliver (2000), consider how the elements they discuss align with or differ from Palmer’s (2017) description of learning communities.\nHerrington, J. and Oliver, R.

    "text": "2.1 Belonging to Myself\nIn order to create authentic, safe learning spaces for others, we must first be comfortable with who we are.\nIdentity: Knowing ourselves as teachers means that we must explore what Palmer (2017) calls the “inner landscape.” We must be aware of the character traits, personal experiences, values, beliefs, and cultural environment in which we were raised and now live. These elements are part of our identity – and we bring our identity with us into the classroom and learning spaces in which we coach and teach others (Palmer, 2017).\nIntegrity: So, too, our integrity comes with us into the learning spaces in which we teach. Integrity, from Palmer’s (2017) discussion, is not about ethics, but about an integrated sense of self – a self that is whole, integrating life experiences and values and beliefs in a meaningful, authentic way.\nWhether we are aware of it or not, our integrity and identity are part of who we are as teachers. It is on this foundation that we build connections with students, and are able to invite them into spaces where personal transformation and authentic learning will take place.\nAuthenticity is also an essential ingredient for effective leadership. Authentic leadership includes elements of both self-knowledge and identity, as well as collaboration with others within the context of relationship (Northhouse, 2019). Avolio, Walumbwa and Weber (2009) provide a model of authentic leadership that includes “self-awareness, internalized moral perspective, balanced processing, and relational transparency” (as cited in Northhouse, 2019, p. 198).\nHowever, even when we long to be vulnerable and authentic within our roles as teachers or leaders, we are often challenged by our own desire to project competence and strength, thinking that vulnerability and strength are mutually exclusive. Despite our need for authentic leaders and teachers, many of us remain reluctant to share any level of vulnerability – perhaps even more so when we are in positions of influence, as teachers, coaches, or leaders.\nIn her book, Imposter Phenomenon: When Success Makes You Feel Like a Fake, Clance (1985) argues that many of us enter the arena of public engagement and career with concerns about whether we really belong. This fear often means we are afraid that being vulnerable or authentic will reveal to others that we do not truly “belong” in our roles.\nThe first step to belonging, as seen in the work of Brown (2017) and Palmer (2017) is a sense of our own identity – including both our strengths and our areas of disconnection or discontent. Both these scholars urge us to understand our own humanity – to “learn to trust ourselves and trust others” (Brown, 2017, p. 37).\nAs poet Maya Angelou discusses, belonging to one’s self is an ongoing journey – a journey that is not always easy.\n\nI belong to myself. – Maya Angelou, 1973\n\n\n2.1.1 Activity: Who are you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nFor this activity, you are asked to share a little more about yourself with your peers. First, find a quote about either identity or integrity. For example, you may want to perform a Google image search for “identity quote.” Find one that resonates with you, and then include a picture of something that tells us something about you. Post the quote and your image to the Unit 2 Discussion forum with a 1-2 sentence explanation. This is a non-graded activity, but may help you reflect on this topic and to prepare for the assignment in this unit.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Activity: View and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nView the following resources and reflect on your learning:\n\nRead.

Students also wrestle with similar questions – How much of myself should I share in this class? This paper? This blog? Is this a safe space to express my own feelings of vulnerability?\nAuthenticity is built on trust – spaces in which you are comfortable enough to share your true self – your identity. Brown (2017) argues that “self-trust” provides a foundation for belonging.\n\nAuthenticity involves both owning one’s personal experiences (values, thoughts, emotions and beliefs) and acting in accordance with one’s true self (expressing what you really think and believe and behaving accordingly) (Harter, 2002, as cited in Gardner, Avolio, Luthans, May, and Walumbwa, 2005, pp. 344-5).\n\nGardner et al. (2005) describe authentic leadership is demonstrated when “relationships are characterized by: a) transparency, openness, and trust, b) guidance toward worthy objectives, and c) an emphasis on follower development” (p. 345).\nIf effective relationships include these characteristics, then authentic teachers and leaders must consider what it means to be transparent and open, as well as what it means to extend trust.\n\n2.2.1 Activity: Vulnerability Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nWatch the TedTalk by Brene Brown: (20 minutes)\nWatch:The power of vulnerability | Brené Brown (20 minutes)\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhat elements of a learning community would create conditions for learners to be vulnerable about their fears about the course, their concerns about learning, and their questions regarding whether they are capable of achieving success in their course?\nIn what ways do you feel vulnerable as a teacher/facilitator?

One of these “Liberating Structures” is the strategy of the “Nine Whys,” which allows participants to clarify what is important in their work. You may choose to use a strategy like this in your role as a facilitator and teacher. For this learning activity, however, you will use the strategy of the “Nine Whys” to consider your own identity as a teacher/facilitator.\nIdentify someone in your life who knows you well, with whom you have a history of talking about your goals or dreams. Ask them to participate in this exercise with you.\n\nBegin by telling them why you are taking this course, as well as why you want to engage in teaching/coaching/facilitation.\nWhen you have finished talking, your “Nine Whys” partner will ask you: Why is that important to you?\nYour partner should continue asking that question up to nine times, or until you cannot go any deeper.\nAt this point, you will have uncovered something fundamental about your identity as a teacher/facilitator. As you complete this exercise, take detailed notes in your Reflective Learning Journal. You will be asked to create a discussion post about this experience in the Unit 2 Assessment.",

She contrasts a true sense of “belonging” to “fitting in” which she describes as a sense of being accepted, but not as one’s true self.\n\nWe want to be part of something, but we need it to be real – not conditional or fake or constantly up for negotiation. We need true belonging. – Brene Brown (2017, p. 31)\n\nAccording to Brown (2017), belonging involves a certain level of vulnerability, because it means we are must show up as our true selves – and those selves often include some level of doubt or weakness or insecurity.\nShe defines “belonging” this way:\n\nBelonging is the innate human desire to be part of something larger than us. Because this yearning is so primal, we often try to acquire it by fitting in and by seeking approval, which are not only hollow substitutes for belonging, but often barriers to it. Because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self-acceptance – (Brown, 2017, p. 32).\n\nPart of our role as teachers and facilitates or to foster learning communities where students can truly belong.",

    "section": "3.2 Creating Learning Spaces Where Students Belong",
    "text": "3.2 Creating Learning Spaces Where Students Belong\nLearning, by its nature, requires us to wrestle with ideas and facts and theoretical perspectives that are new or contradict our current knowledge or beliefs. Therefore, learning spaces must serve as spaces where we can be challenged by new ideas and challenge our current thinking, while at the same time feel confident that our thoughts and perspective are valued. These learning spaces must simultaneously allow us to be our authentic selves – and allow others to be authentic as well.\nBrene Brown (2017) discusses key concepts of creating spaces that facilitate a sense of belonging – including civility, inclusive language, truth, and respect. Often, the balance between truth and civility can be challenging – as we seek to authentically discuss new ideas – but in a manner that is both civil and respectful of others.\nTrust is at the heart of authentic learning communities. Brown (2017) uses the acronym “BRAVING” to describe key elements of trust. These elements include Boundaries, Reliability, Accountability, Vault, Integrity, Non-Judgement, and Generosity (p. 114).\nPalmer (2017) also argues that spaces free of fear are necessary for authentic learning. He describes a “shutdown” that occurs as we seek to protect ourselves – both teachers and students – and as we think about learning and knowing in from an either-or perspective, failing to acknowledge the great vastness of truth. Learning communities, then, must be places of trust, with a focus on learning that incorporates both “profound truth” and “paradox” (Palmer, 2017, p. 65).\nBrower and Dettinger (1998) contend that diversity of thought and perspective is an essential element of a learning community. “When we define a community as a group of individuals committed to shared values and goals, who purposefully come together and work together to reach these goals, then diversity is encouraged not just for ideological reasons but also because different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds contribute to the collaborative efforts to achieve the community’s goals” (Brower & Dettinger, 1998, p. 16).\n\n3.2.1 Activity: Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nFind a quiet space in your home or outdoors. Make your favourite beverage. With your iced coffee or hot tea with honey next to you, settle into a comfortable position.\nRead the poem by Rainer Maria Rilke “Ah, not to be cut off”. Sit for a moment with this poem. Re-read it. Consider the words and ideas expressed by Rilke.\nIn your Reflective Journal, jot down your thoughts. Consider how you have, in your own learning experiences, experienced “the winds of homecoming” or the desire “not to be cut off.”\n\nImage by Engin Akyurt from Pixabay\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nThere are three reading options to help you reflect on inclusive learning communities.\n\nRead: Brown (2017). Chapters 3-6.\n\n\nIn preparation for the discussion in this unit, reflect on the BRAVING checklist (p. 114).\nHow would you apply this concept in a course to create an inclusive, authentic learning community?\n\n\nRead Palmer (2017) Chapter 2. As you read, consider these questions:\n\n\nHow am I “at home in a universe that embraces both the smallness of ‘I’ and the vastness of all that is ‘not I,’”? (Palmer, 2017, p. 59).\nWhat fears do I need to overcome as a teacher so I can create space for students to express their fears?\n\n\nRead Westheimer et. al (2004) Education Leading to Good Citizens.\n\n\nHow would you apply what the authors are saying in a course to create an inclusive, authentic learning community?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Activity: Listen and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nListen to A Place in this World, sung by Taylor Swift.\nConsider the following scenario:\nImagine a student in a course you are facilitating. A young student submits a poorly written assignment and then does not complete the next week’s assignment. When you ask the student to meet with you, she shares this song with you and shares that she feels all alone, she doesn’t feel confident writing at an academic level, and she didn’t do this week’s assignment because she’s afraid she will fail. She thinks she probably shouldn’t have been admitted to this program.\nIn your Reflective Journal, compose an email or talking points for a conversation with the student, specifically describing why she belongs in this course.",

A learning community can be created within a specific course, academic program, or professional context. Learning communities can be found across university campuses and often include a set of interdisciplinary, paired-courses that students take as a cohort. They can be grounded in residence halls with an integration of living and learning. Or, they can be developed in formal educational environments with a focus on students learning together as a cohort. Professional learning communities have also emerged as an important force in education and other fields, as colleagues gather around a shared interest, a focus on continuous quality improvement, and a shared discipline.\nLearning communities are authentic, emotionally-safe and inclusive spaces (whether physical or virtual) where learners and teachers come together to engage in deep learning.

    "text": "4.1 Learning Community Pyramid\nThe Learning Community Pyramid, developed by Brower & Dettinger (1998) includes academic, social, and physical components. They describe academic components as those that focus on the curriculum and learning that takes place. The social components are the elements of trust and inclusivity that create space for community. The physical component is the “place or facility where the community meets or resides” (Brower & Dettinger, 1998, p. 17). In the case of this course, that “place” is the course hub.\nBuilding on the foundation of social, physical, and academic elements, Brower and Dettinger (1998) contend that learning communities also include three areas of responsibility: ethical responsibility, civic responsibility, and professional responsibility (p. 17).\nAccording to Brower & Dettinger (1998), “Learning communities, to be considered as such, must integrate academic subject matter and social interactions while providing the physical space or facility for an intellectually stimulating environment to emerge. Furthermore, learning communities must be designed to develop a triad of responsibilities within students—professional, ethical, and civic” (p. 16).\nAs you consider the learning community you will facilitate, consider how you might develop or model professional, ethical, and civic responsibility within that community.

    "text": "4.2 The Community of Truth (Palmer, 2017)\nPalmer’s learning community model (2017) incorporates both learning and community with a “subject” as the center, surrounded by “knowers” who are in relationship to both each other and the subject. Palmer (2017) assets that “the community of truth, far from being linear and static and hierarchical, is circular, interactive, and dynamic” (p. 106).\n\nFigure 4.1: Palmer’s Community of Truth model.\nThe learning that takes place in this model is captured in this statement: “I understand truth as the passionate and disciplined process of inquiry and dialogue itself, as the dynamic conversation of a community that keeps testing old conclusions and coming into new ones” (p. 106).\nAs teachers, we approach teaching with some sense that we have some thing (some subject) to teach students. Palmer (2017) challenges us to think differently about the teaching/learning experience. (See “The Objectivist Myth of Knowing,” p. 103 and “The Community of Truth,” p. 105).\nInstead of solely focusing on what we must teach (and what students must learn), Palmer challenges us to consider how we all might learn something more together – more than is already known – through the teaching/learning experience. In this way, we must consider that we are not just engaged in transferring information or knowledge, but that (in addition to that), together we might create new knowledge.\n\nI know of no field, from science to religion, where what we regard as objective knowledge did not emerge from long and complex communal discourse that continues to this day, no field where the facts of the matter were delivered fully formed from on high (Palmer, 2017, p. 107).\n\nPalmer’s (2017) model highlights the relational knowledge of learning communities, underscoring not just the relationship of the people involved, but also the relationships between people and subject. As you consider facilitating learning communities, give some thought to your own relationship to the subject to be taught and learned. Consider whether you “know” this subject objectively or subjectively.\n\n4.2.1 Activity: Palmer Reading and Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nRead The Courage to Teach, Chapter 4 “Knowing in Community” (Palmer, 2017).\nIn your Reflective Journal: - Write down three strengths of this learning community model. - Write 2-3 questions you have about this learning community. - Do you think this model accurately reflects the type of learning community you want to create? - Why or Why not?",

As we engage in teaching and learning, we must always be aware that the learning process is, fundamentally, transformative. It engages people, not only on an intellectual level, but also on a spiritual and social level. By designing curriculum, pedagogy, and learning around all aspects of learning – social, cognitive, and spiritual – we provide the foundation for transformational learning.\nPalmer (2017) puts it this way:\n\nThe reality we belong to, the reality we long to know, extends far beyond human beings interacting with one another… This is a community held together not only by our personal powers of thought and feeling but also by the power of ‘the grace of great things’” (p. 109).\n\nAs Palmer (2017) points out, learning includes both thought (cognitive) and feeling (social), but also something beyond those – the overarching spiritual nature of life and learning.",

    "section": "5.1 Creating Collaborative Learning in an Online Environment",
    "text": "5.1 Creating Collaborative Learning in an Online Environment\nIn our role as a teacher or facilitator, we are engaged in leading learners through a transformational educational process. “Collaborative Inquiry” is a process through which we, as educators, engage in learning about the practice of teaching through collaborative inquiry and reflection (Donohoo & Velasco, 2016).\nAthabasca University defines a Community of Inquiry as “a group of individuals who collaboratively engage in purposeful critical discourse and reflection to construct personal meaning and confirm mutual understanding” (Athabasca University, n.d.).\nWhile Collaborative Inquiry is often used to describe a process used by professional learning communities to guide organizational change – or to describe Communities of Practice among educators – collaborative inquiry is also a practice that can be implemented within classrooms.\nThe fields of Collaborative Inquiry (Donohoo & Velasco, 2016) and Appreciative Inquiry (Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010) are built on the premise that we must all collaborate together in a community of learners, and that by doing so, we can generate learning that goes beyond what we might learn on our own. It is a strengths-based approach to learning and change that has been described as “unifying moments when joy touches joy, strength touches strength, health touches health, inspiration combines with inspiration – and how to make the combinations happen more rapidly and frequently” (Cooperrider, D., as cited in Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. xiii).\nPalmer’s (2017) “Community of Truth” that we explored in the last unit, incorporates the essence of collaborative learning, underscoring the importance of relationship within education. He writes, “What seems right for me, after many years of searching, is to sit in a circle with my students (or try to relate to the crowd in a lecture hall as if we were in a circle) and lead an inquiry into the great thing in our midst, But there are other ways to create community in the classroom, and some of them look nothing like the interactive encounter we normally associate with that word” (p. 139).\nWhitney & Trosten-Bloom cast a compelling vision for collaborative environments where the act of engaging in appreciative inquiry can transform communities. They write: “Appreciative Inquiry transforms organizations into places that are free and alive, where people are eager and filled with positive power, and where the creativity of the whole never ceases to amaze, surprise, and innovate” (Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. xi). Learning communities, too, can become places that are free and alive, where all members of the community engage in challenging, authentic learning.\nAppreciative Inquiry (Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010) is built on eight principles, which can inform the way we support learners in an online learning context. These include:\n\nThe Constructionist Principle\nThe Simultaneity Principle\nThe Poetic Principle\nThe Anticipatory Principle\nThe Positive Principle\nThe Wholeness Principle\nThe Enactment Principle\nThe Free-Choice Principle\n\n(Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. 52).\n\n\n\n\n\nThese principles can serve as a guide for facilitating online discussions, designing lessons, and providing formative feedback to learners. For example, the “Simultaneity Principle” is based on the premise that by its nature, asking questions not only leads to change, but the very act of engaging in inquiry is, in fact, the first step in change. According to this principle, “the moment we ask a question, we begin to create a change” (Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. 52).\nLikewise, the “Free-Choice Principle” contends that “people perform better and are more committed when they have freedom to choose how and what they contribute” (Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. 52). Facilitating discussions that allow learners to engage in conversation (whether face-to-face or online), determine some aspects of their assignments, select topics, etc., can have a powerful influence on student engagement with learning.\n\n5.1.1 Activity: Palmer Reading and Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nRead: Palmer, P. (2017) The Courage to Teach, Chapter 5 Teaching in Community; Chapter 6 Learning in Community, Chapter 7 Divided No More.\nIn your Reflective Journal, make notes on the following questions:\n\nWhat specific actions could you take to invite students in to the “community of truth”?\nWhat questions can I ask to invite students to engage in collaborative, inquiry-based learning?\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Activity: AI Read and Discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nReview the “Principles of Appreciative Inquiry” from the Appreciative Inquiry Commons at Champlain University. (Also in Whitney & Trosten-Bloom. (2010). The power of appreciative inquiry: A practical guide to positive change.)\n\nSelect two of the Principles of Appreciative Inquiry. In a 250-word discussion post, describe a learning activity you would conduct with your class that integrates both of these principles. For example, how would you design a writing assignment that included “Positive Principle”?\nOr, describe an assignment through which you ask students to create a short video that incorporates the “Poetic Principle.”",

    "section": "5.2 Supporting Connections Between Learners",
    "text": "5.2 Supporting Connections Between Learners\nCreating a positive, open, learning environment is a critical component for fostering authentic learning – a place where we can both belong to ourselves and to others.\nBrown (2017) poses these questions:\n\nAre we willing to show up and be seen when we can’t control the outcome? Are we willing to create courageous spaces so we can be fully seen? (p. 154)\n\nPalmer (2017), offers five suggestions for ways in which we can prepare students for engagement in authentic communities – both in education, our places of work, and our communities.\n\nWe must help our students debunk the myth that institutions process autonomous, even ultimate, power over our lives.\nWe must validate the importance of our students’ emotions as well as their intellect.\nWe must teach our students how to “mine” their emotions for knowledge.\nWe must teach them how to cultivate community or the sake of both knowing and doing.\nWe must teach – and model for – our students what is meant to be on the journey toward “an undivided life.” (p. 205).\n\nIn this course, we are exploring concepts of education that include our emotional experiences with learning, the importance of community, the nature of knowledge, and the foundational importance of the teacher’s authenticity. For some academics, the acknowledgement of the emotional experience of education can be challenging, according to Palmer, who argues that the feelings we have influence our learning.\nDonohoo and Velasco (2016), in their work on Collaborative Inquiry, also underscore the importance of acknowledging the emotional experiences of student. “There is no doubt that learning is interrupted when negative emotions and attitudes surface, as such feelings hinder our ability to make sense of things” (Donohoo and Velasco, 2016, p. 36).\n\n5.2.1 Activity: View and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nFor this activity, you will spend some time reflecting on your own experience as a learner, in order to consider the needs of the students you lead in online and face-to-face learning environments. So pick up your Reflective Learning Journal, grab your laptop, and settle down into a comfy chair (or sit among some trees).\n\nWatch: Identity by Kalhil KJ Adames (5 minutes)\n\n\n\nListen: Sara Bareilles - Brave\n\n\n\nRead: Brown (2017) Braving the Wilderness, Chapter 7 Strong Back. Soft Front. Wild Heart.\n\nJot down some of your notes describing your own identity as a student.\n\nList 2-3 times in your educational experience where you have been “brave” by sharing your thoughts or concerns in a learning environment – whether with other learners or teachers.\nList 2-3 times when you wanted to speak up, but chose instead to remain silent.\nReflect on how these actions impacted your experience as a learner. Consider what you might do, as a course facilitator, to encourage learners to speak up.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Activity: Read and Strategize\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nRead Burwell & Huyser (2013). Practicing hospitality in the classroom (available through the TWU Library.\nIn your Reflective Learning Journal, make a note of the “stances” described by the authors. For each Stance, list one strategy you can employ to practice hospitality in your classes. Be as specific as possible.",

    "section": "6.1 The Impact of Identity in a Learning Environment",
    "text": "6.1 The Impact of Identity in a Learning Environment\nAn essential question for adult educators to reflect on is: What matters to me and how can my work advance this in some way? Discovering and acting upon a purpose beyond oneself brings meaning to work and can motivate learners to find meaning also. This leads to a deeper commitment and sense of fulfillment. Having a greater purpose creates unity and fights fragmentation in the activities of life. The words of Jean Vanier are a call to action for all adult educators:\n\nIt is always good for individuals, communities and indeed nations, to remember that their present situation is a result of the thousands of gestures of love or hate that came before. This obliges us to remember that the community of tomorrow is being born of our fidelity to the present. We discover that we are at the same time very insignificant and very important because each of our actions is preparing the humanity of tomorrow; it is a tiny contribution to the huge and glorious final humanity. (Vanier, 1989, p.152)\n\n\nWhat we value, we prioritize, and this directs our work and lives, shaping not just what we do but who we become. We need to start practicing now who we want to be in the future (Bregman, P., 2016).\n\nAdult educators have a privileged position in the lives of their students that can be leveraged to help them develop the skills, attitudes and dispositions they need to improve their lives and those of others. In this sense, an adult educator is a leader of self and a leader in the classroom. Who we are matters.\nFiguring out how our identity impacts the learning environment involves discerning our personal values through self-reflection. What makes us act and react the way we do? Through what screens do we view and respond to life? On what basis do we make decisions? Questions, like those in the following list (Atha et al., 2018, p. 26), can assist with the values and identity discernment process:\n\nWhat is important to me?\nWhat makes me feel fulfilled?\nWhat make me feel angry or indignant?\nWhat makes my life meaningful?\nWhat makes me feel fulfilled and gets my adrenalin flowing?\nWhat influences my decision-making process?\nHow do I like to be treated?\nHow do I treat others?\n\n\n6.1.1 Activity: Wheatley Reading and Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nRead Wheatley, M. (2017). Who Do We Choose to Be? : Facing Reality, Claiming Leadership, Restoring Sanity. Oakland, CA: Berrett-Koehler Publishers. Opening pages 2-25; Chapters 1 (pages 28-61 and 2 (pages 63-97). As you read these pages think about a teacher, instructor or professor who is/was a leader in your eyes - someone you’ve most admired. What were their behaviours? How did you feel in their classroom? What kind of student were you, including the quality of what you produced? How do you feel about them now?\nAs you read Wheatley (2017) answer the following questions in your Reflective Learning Journal:\n\nWrite a summary sentence for each major idea/concept that relates to belonging.\nChoose the concept that you would like to apply in your own learning communities, both as a student and teacher/facilitator.\nFormulate one question that emerged from this reading that you will explore and consider in future course readings and discussions.\n\nAs you prepare your discussion post, refer to these notes.",

    "section": "6.2 The Adult Educator as Creator and Leader of a Learner Centered Learning Environment",
    "text": "6.2 The Adult Educator as Creator and Leader of a Learner Centered Learning Environment\nBeing ‘learner centered’ means teaching people not subjects. It means thinking about who is in your class, their prior knowledge about the topic, any fears or resistance they may bring to the topic and only then planning for facilitation of content. The person of the learner - not the curriculum - is the primary focus. A skillful educator however, will use the content to impact the learner and attain learning objectives. For adult educators who strive to be servant leaders, the undergirding value is human dignity, as philosopher Immanuel Kant admonishes:\n\nAct so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only. (Rachels, 1986, p. 1)\n\nServant leadership is an appropriate model for adult educators who strive to:\n\nserve others by investing in their development and well-being for the benefit of the common good. … aspire to be great only in their service to others… with integrity, humility, sincere concern, a generous, forgiving and giving heart, and self-discipline… by investing, empowering, caring for, and consulting others. (Atha et al, 2018, p. 1)\n\nThe resources you have in Brookfield, Silberman and Lipmanowiz and McCandess are learner centered in that their goal is learner engagement. Skillful adult educators try to avoid what Lipmanowicz and McCandless (2013) assert:\n\nUnwittingly, the conventional structures used to organize how people routinely work together stifle inclusion and engagement. Conventional structures are either too inhibiting (presentations, status reports and managed discussions) or too loose and disorganized (open discussions and brainstorms) to creatively engage people in shaping their own future. They frequently generate feelings of frustration and/or exclusion and fail to provide space for good ideas to emerge and germinate. (from http://www.liberatingstructures.com/home/)\n\nBy incorporating liberating structures or those suggested by Brookfield and Silberman, you will indeed avoid methods and processes that stifle. Instead, you will liberate learners to express themselves and be transformed into agents of transformation. Strategies for engagement build confidence and can have a strong, positive impact on self-efficacy and identity in the sense of empowering learners to take action. As an adult educator you have a role of equipping leaders – whether for self-leadership or leadership with others. This broader view of the role can also be purpose-filled and motivating so embrace and enjoy it!\n\n6.2.1 Activity: Strategies for Supporting Learners\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\n\nThe belief in technology to fix the messes we’ve made and to save us from decline has been labeled by Ronald Wright, ‘The Progress Trap’ (Wheatley, p. 41).\n\nWheatley’s point is that an over-reliance on technology is not helpful in the creation of an adult learning environment. What is then?\nBrowse through the Brookfield, Silberman texts and the Liberating Structures website. Jot down in your journal what actions and strategies (whether technology-oriented or not) an adult educator can choose, to support and focus on people and relationships in a technologically-driven world.",

    "text": "7.1 The Role of Information and Perception in Growth and Development\n\n“Information is the source of all growth and development in a living system” (Wheatley, 2017, p. 101).\n\nWheatley goes on to explain how information has changed from “communications among people to high speed transmissions delivered in cyberspace” (p. 104).\nWhile information is still important, it is the mode of delivery that has reshaped culture. She argues that the digital age has destroyed the information age. The adult educator can respond to her call to re-establish our relationships with the real world by choosing strategies that privilege connection and meaning and lead to better decisions. She illustrates this by describing in some depth the value of an ‘After Action Review’ (see pages 128-132). Consider how this might be adapted for the adult education setting in your context.\nPerception based on scientific understanding is not the only way of knowing. Wheatley admonishes:\n\n“There are other ways of knowing reality, reliable methods that have served humans and earlier hominids for millennia. It is the arrogance of our science that denies their existence and their usefulness” (p. 179).\n\nHow can adult educators incorporate other ways of knowing? Cahalan, K. (2016) has identified eight ways of knowing that are essential to wise practice:\n\nSituated awareness is noticing and describing contextual factors.\nEmbodied realizing is developing skilled competence in bodily action.\nConceptual understanding is comprehending and remembering key information.\nCritical thinking is analyzing and evaluating concepts and actions.\nEmotional attunement is identifying and using awareness of feelings and affective states.\nCreative insight is developing imaginative and creative responses.\nSpiritual discernment is perceiving what is of God and not of God.\nPractical reasoning is problem-solving, forming judgments, gaining a sense of salience, and acting wisely.\n\nHow we perceive, and teach learners to perceive, matters greatly and is a foundational responsibility of the adult educator. For example, in choosing texts, articles or other resources the type of information you get students to pay attention to will affect their awareness of contextual factors. Embodied realizing in the classroom may take the form of an experiential learning activity where the students are asked to interview someone, ‘shadow’ them for a time or else listen to a podcast and describe their ‘gut reactions’ or impressions. Reading biographies is an excellent way for learners to become more emotionally attuned to the feelings and affective states of others. This develops empathy – a crucial component of being hospitable in a diverse, pluralistic society.\nWheatley identifies a warrior for the human spirit as\n\na decent human being who aspires to be of service in an indecent, inhumane time (p. 255).\n\nIn this sense, adult educators are called to be warriors for the human spirit. Read pages 258-259 for ethical principles that are quite likely to move you and profoundly influence your perception of your role.\n\n7.1.1 Activity: Wheatley Reading and Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nRead Wheatley, M.

    "section": "7.2 The Adult Educator as Servant Leader",
    "text": "7.2 The Adult Educator as Servant Leader\nServant Leadership requires a strong orientation to values that allow adult educators to know, care about, and serve their learners well. Since beliefs, influenced by context and culture influence decision making, expectations and emotions, it matters greatly what leadership model you adhere and aspire to. What we value, we prioritize and this shapes our work and lives.\nBy way of example of what servant leadership can look like as an adult educator, I share part of my own journey with you. As a Canadian educator one key challenge I face is the mandate to indigenize the curriculum. This is part of a broader call to educational leaders to work toward healing and reconciliation. In Canadian history, education was used as a tool of assimilation to extricate children from their culture and language. A statement of the Indigenous Healing Foundation succinctly summarizes the gravity of this call to action:\n\nNo other population group in Canada’s history has endured such a deliberate, comprehensive, and prolonged assault on their human rights as that of Indigenous people. Yet, despite growing recognition of past wrongs, many Canadians remain unaware of the full scope of these injustices or their impacts. More than a political mandate however, educators need to realize our moral responsibilities to relate accurately and acknowledge fully our regrettable past. I propose that the effort educators in Canada are undergoing requires servant leadership dispositions. For me, this has been, and continues to be, a process of developing knowledge of my own ignorance, discovering my own prejudices and myths and having the courage to change views and practices. It has required the disposition to work through intellectual and emotional complexities that have caused confusion and frustration. But I am willing to be disturbed and unsettled. As I strive to live servant leadership principles, I approach this challenge with intellectual humility, curiosity and respect for all people which has taken much of the fear of ‘doing it wrong’ away.\n\nOur world is in need of adult educators who strive to live servant leadership principles in their practice. The resulting wideness of spirit dedicated toward the welfare of others is magnanimity - what Aristotle called the crowing virtue in his hierarchy of virtues. The adult educator has an important role in creating a more peaceful world through education that serves people and influences others to do the same.\nFor more information about servant leadership, please see the resource section for this unit.\n\n7.2.1 Activity: Servant Leadership Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nWatch the video, Ali Fett: Servant Leadership - How a jar can change the way you lead and serve.\nAs you view this 18 minute video, consider the following:\n\nHow might assumption and perceptions impact your role as an adult educator?\nHow are adult educators servant leaders?\n\nWatch: Servant Leadership: How a jar can change the way you lead and serve",

    "section": "8.1 Adult Education Methods to Teach from Depth",
    "text": "8.1 Adult Education Methods to Teach from Depth\nWhat does it mean to teach from depth? It connects to the principle of adult learning that adults are internally motivated and build on prior life experience when they learn. Motivation is tapped into and amplified through reflective techniques and critical discussions that help the adult make sense of the new learning and situate it into what they already know. Asking thoughtful questions can lead this inquiry so that the learner constructs their own meaning. The facilitator of adult learning recognizes what Fenwick (2010) refers to as ‘the mess’ of learning and therefore strategically employs different levels of learning, making connections and establishing networks of information, while being aware of context and power dynamics.\nTeaching from depth means nurturing and valuing self-awareness, committing to self-reflection and mindfulness and practicing teaching from depth. This last point is important in order to balance reflection and introspection with action. Herminia Ibarra (2015) refers to this as ‘outsight’ (in contrast to insight) and argues that direct experiences and experimentation are important in order to develop external perspective. In the context of facilitating adult education this means trying out various strategies and learning through trial, error, refinement and adjustment. Where internal knowledge, past experience and thinking contribute to insight, external knowledge, new experience and acting contribute to outsight (p. 6). Teaching from depth involves developing insight and outsight – through utilizing both reflective practices and strategies and experiential learning.\nOne strategy that can be used to teach for depth is called Stanislavski’s Magic If (Schuyler, p. 204). Stanislavski introduced method acting in the early twentieth century. This method, often referred to as role play, is where actors draw from their own life experiences to produce truthful actions and emotions. In the context of adult education, the learner imagines the circumstances of a particular learning experience and tries to figure out what to do in that situation. This technique is often applied in the classroom when case studies are utilized so that the learner’s life experiences are bridged via the imaginary situation, challenging the learner to construct and integrate new meaning while being solutions-focused.\nAmong the many examples in Brookfield’s Discussion Book some of the strategies that foster teaching for depth include:\n\nSnowballing p. 49,\nCritical Incident Questionnaire (CIQ) p. 59,\nNominating Questions p. 77 and\nWriting Discussion p. 157.\n\nI encourage you to review these particular strategies and add to your proverbial ‘toolkit’.\n\n8.1.1 Activity: Video on Adult Learning Principles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nWatch Cason Smith’s, The Six Adult Learning Principles.\nAs you view this video, jot down the principles in your reflection journal for future reference when you complete the company website analysis assignment. Reflect one or two of these principles and consider how you might apply them to practice, and also how they relate to your “Philosophy of Learning Communities” you developed in Unit 5.\nWatch: The Six Adult Learning Principles\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Activity: Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nRead Fenwick, T. (2010). Workplace ‘Learning’ and Adult Education: Messy Objects, blurry maps and making difference. European Journal for Research on the Education and Learning of Adults. I, 79-95.\nAs you read this article, focus on the eight categories of workplace learning beginning on page 81 and only read the rest of the article if you are interested. Consider how these categories connect with the adult learning principles you looked at in your website analysis assignment.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Activity: Role Play\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nPractice using role play by planning a teaching and learning activity that utilizes role play. Consider a discipline of interest to you or a concept of leadership that you want students to engage with further. Sketch out the directions to your future class for a role play activity. Alternatively, you may want to practice role play with a colleague, family member, or friend. Select a topic, such as belonging or community, and develop a role play to teach that concept within an online or face-to-face learning environment.",

    "text": "8.2 Web of Relationships and Impact on Values\nWe are who we are partly because of who we associate with. Perhaps you remember your parents cautioning you to choose your friends wisely. Perhaps you are a parent who understands this and has given similar advice to your own children. Even the contemporary business literature recommends that as adults we are aware of whom we choose to associate.\nIn her book Executive Presence, Sylvia Ann Hewlett (2014) emphasizes how connections are fostered through eye contact, ‘commanding a room’ and ‘right-sizing your reputation’. To deepen gravitas, the chief component of executive presence, she suggests “living intentionally, guided by a set of values… surround[ing] yourself with people who are better than you… [and] empower[ing] others’ presence to build your own” (p. 40-41). Our interconnectedness and relationships incrementally construct a living, learning, self-organizing group or organization (Wheatley, p. 226-240). Chapter 6 encourages us to prioritize collaboration, belonging and community. As adult educators and transformational servant leaders, we should heed this call to action for the benefit of our learners.\nWho we associate with impacts our values and our values have the potential to impact those with whom we associate. Being reliable, consistently following through on commitments is a foundational value that impacts and is impacted by the web of relationships we encounter in our work and life generally. Lytkina Botelho et al. (2017) did a ten-year study that identified specific attributes of high-performing CEOs. I would suggest that one of the attributes in particular can also describe high-performing adult educators and learners, that is, ‘delivering reliably’ (p. 10): “The ability to reliably produce results was possibly the most powerful of the four essential CEO behaviors.” (I encourage you to read the article to learn more about the other essential behaviors for CEO success: deciding with speed and conviction, engaging for impact and adapting proactively.). Consider how your values are impacted by your associates and how your values impact others. Wheatley emphasizes the power of this network: “people adopt the mores of a culture, even those that contradict their personal values. … The culture is in control, and most people unconsciously adapt” (p. 229). She encourages us to be conscious in our rebellion and reclaim life-affirming identities by being “fully engaged, carefully observing what’s going on as we do our work, learning from experience, applying those learnings, adapting, changing” (p. 231). How might you foster life-affirming identities in your particular learning environment?\n\n8.2.1 Activity: Wheatley Reading and Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nRead Chapter 6 (pages 211-243) of Wheatley, M. (2017). Who Do We Choose to Be: Facing Reality, Claiming Leadership, Restoring Sanity. Oakland, CA: Berrett-Koehler Publishers.\nAs you read this chapter think about Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s comment\n\nWe exist in a bundle of life. We say, ‘A person is a person through other people.’ It is not ‘I think therefore I am’ [but rather] I am human because I belong. I participate, I share (Wheatley, p. 223).",

Because when we honestly know ourselves and we join a sense of humble awareness with a sincere desire to work with others to make a positive impact, we have more confidence, self-efficacy and an increased willingness to engage – even in difficult situations. In the Bible we read that God is working through all things for our good (Romans 8:28). If we really believe this, consider how this belief might influence your thinking, allowing you to find peace and a humble confidence even in difficult situations.\nHow does one get to know oneself? Times of solitude spent reading, creating, walking in nature, relationships with others, new experiences, travel are all activities that allow us to get to know ourselves, depending on our frame of mind. If we read material that helps us ask some of the questions mentioned above through exploring the life of another person (fictional or real) or if we take part in experiences that help us discover what we are good or what matters to us, these will lead to increased self-knowledge. Flannery O’Connor illustrates the power of narrative saying:\n\nThere is something in us, as storytellers and as listeners to stories, that demands the redemptive act, that demands that what falls at least be offered the chance to be restored. (Arntz, V. 2018)\n\nWhy does this matter for the adult educator? It matters because education is about transformation of people – not just their intellectual growth but themselves. Transformation requires knowing oneself first.\nWhile Wheatley somewhat discounts the role of hope (278-280), Christian leaders and teachers are indeed people of hope and optimism who nonetheless realize the importance of Havel’s definition that\n\nHope is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something is worth doing no matter how it turns out” (Wheatley, 280).\n\nIn other words, we need to welcome the reality of whatever learners are bringing to the learning environment and look for the possibilities hidden in it - the possibilities for redemption and restoration. For example, some learners may have painful memories of school, a sense of inadequacy or else an inflated view of themselves. Some learners may have experienced severe trauma that affects their ability to process information. Some learners may have trouble reading or writing to the level we would hope they could achieve as graduate students. Whoever our learners are and whatever abilities or disabilities they bring, we need to create the conditions so they can become better human beings and more knowledgeable and skillful because of having spent time with us as their learning guides.\nOur hope and vision must be rooted in the present (See Daily Thoughts from JeanVanier). If that present is fraught with difficulties and challenges, the self-aware teacher leader embraces that reality and moves forward trusting themselves and, for the Christian, trusting God is working all things for our good. This requires courage – as Wheatley notes it is rooted in ‘coeur’ or heart (279). Courage with heart is needed to face the challenges of handling challenging situations when we ourselves might not feel equipped. Courage with heart tempered by intellectual humility is needed to transform lives through education. Effective adult educators are people with a vision for good, with confidence that they can influence positive change and help facilitate transformation in their learners because they are continually working on their own self-knowledge and will research the strategies and methods as well as the content that will be most helpful for their learners to be successful.\n\n9.1.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nRead Wheatley, M. (2017). Who Do We Choose to Be?: Facing Reality, Claiming Leadership, Restoring Sanity. Oakland, CA: Berrett-Koehler Publishers.

    "section": "9.2 Approaches to Making a Contribution in an Intellectually Humble Way",
    "text": "9.2 Approaches to Making a Contribution in an Intellectually Humble Way\nThe Foundation for Critical Thinking defines intellectual humility:\n\nHaving a consciousness of the limits of one’s knowledge, including a sensitivity to circumstances in which one’s native egocentrism is likely to function self-deceptively; sensitivity to bias, prejudice and limitations of one’s viewpoint. Intellectual humility depends on recognizing that one should not claim more than one actually knows. It does not imply spinelessness or submissiveness. It implies the lack of intellectual pretentiousness, boastfulness, or conceit, combined with insight into the logical foundations, or lack of such foundations, of one’s beliefs.\n\nAs a Christian adult educator, aim to be a servant leader-teacher. As servant leader teacher, seek to engage people’s heads, hearts and hopes and empower learners to turn their newfound knowledge and skills into action. Infuse your role with a perspective of the common good and engage confidently in contemporary cultural tensions. With students who are Christian this perspective of the common good finds its roots and expression in a relationship with Jesus Christ. For students who are not of the Christian faith, strive to espouse this in word and example in a way that is respectful of their heritage and traditions while at the same time giving them an understanding of the Christian worldview. Take the time to listen for what is important to them and to understand their beliefs in order to build bridges of understanding through respect.\nRealizing that our core values, personality traits and characteristics impact to how we learn and teach, take the time to discern your essential values. For example, I have identified the following six essential values to incorporate into my life and teaching: honesty, integrity, persistence, desire to learn, compassion/empathy and community. Because I value compassion/empathy and community, I put the learner first and design my curricula and methodologies to suit the learners in my class. Because I value persistence and the desire to learn, I don’t give up on students and I try to find ways to help them learn through different methods and alternate ways that they can demonstrate their learning.\nThese values direct my entire teaching methodology; I espouse the goals of differentiated instruction (basically changing instructional methods to adapt to different learners) and aim to create a space for learning that empowers all students to succeed. (See here for more information). Differentiated instruction is a seamless part of my instructional planning and practice and I intentionally create opportunities to learn about students’ strengths, needs, interests, preferences and ways of learning. Here is an example of a self-assessment tool to help identify a learner’s learning style. To this end I use meaningful engaging tasks, flexible grouping, and ongoing assessment and adjustment. I differentiate the content, process, or product components of the educational experience by using a range of strategies and methods, e.g., anchor activities, tiered lessons, small-group instruction, and varied tasks.\nI’ve used my own practice as a Christian educator as an example to give you some ideas and direction. Please take the time to explore the resources linked in the notes and other resources in your Brookfield and Silberman texts. The approach taken throughout this course is an intellectually humble one. In chapters five and six Brookfield (2013) particularly addresses the power dynamic in the classroom, awareness of which may foster a more intellectually humble approach. You are encouraged to use your texts as primary resources for more detailed information about specific strategies and approaches to making a contribution as an adult educator while remaining intellectually humble.\n\n9.2.1 Activity: Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nRead this article: Leary, Mark & J.

    "text": "10.2 Administrative and Supervisory Aspects of an Adult Educator\nTeaching a group of learners also involves non-instructional duties. Sometimes there is a tension between our philosophical beliefs about authentic teaching and learning and the organizational realities we face. In addition to creating authentic learning experiences, your teaching responsibilities will often require you to track and report on learners’ progress, submit grades or summary reports to the organization, order textbooks or supplies, work with an assistant such as a learning coach or teacher assistant, book classrooms…. The possibilities are many!\nBeyond your own classroom, you may be asked to contribute to committees and other meetings about the operational aspects of the education facility. Few educators work alone. We are almost all part of an organizational context which has implications for our work. Organizations have expectations and the relationship between the adult educator and the organization is important to consider. Sometimes what is asked of us organizationally conflicts with our philosophy of how to carry out assessment or what it means to advise and guide students on their educational journey. The time invested in meetings is important for the organization to flourish and enable the teaching and learning to happen at all yet, this time commitment can detract from planning authentic learning experiences and having the time to give extensive formative feedback. Every organization is driven by a set of values which will apply to the educational environment. If there is an outside funder for example, then reports to demonstrate progress and results will need great care and handling since this is what makes programs possible at all. Educators must not only promote what they consider the best way to do things but also take into account what others expect and need from the program.\nDuring this course you have focused on how to develop authentic learning communities. Authentic learning communities take place within organizational contexts. Priorities between these two – developing authentic learning communities and organizational realities are not always aligned. However, it behooves the critical thinker to figure out how to align them as much as possible. This is a challenge worth embracing in order to be personally and professionally fulfilled.\n\nNo matter how hopeful our dialogue has been, no matter how many of our colleagues have embraced a new vision, no matter how many practical possibilities we have explored, someone will say, ‘These are wonderful ideas, but every last one of them will be defeated by conditions in my school’ (Palmer, 2017, p. 170).\n\nPalmer (2017) suggests that change begins when we, as individual teachers and facilitators, “make an inward decision to live ‘divided no more,’ finding a center for their lives outside of institutions” and “begin to discover one another and form communities of congruence that offer mutual support and opportunities to develop a shared vision” (pp. 172-3).\n\n10.2.1 Activity: Closing Song\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time:  minutes\n\n\n\nAs a closing activity, enjoy listening to this song. The whole effort of taking this certificate program, of wanting to be involved in transforming others through education and indeed of all our efforts in life, is in anticipation of something more - something ‘fresh and green’. And here is a song to inspire your continued efforts: “Fresh and Green” by Steve Bell.\n\nFRESH AND GREEN (Psalm 92) music and lyrics by Steve Bell\n\n\nFresh and green we will remain Bearing fruit to a ripe old age Happy to tell about Your name A blessed endeavour The righteous flourish like the palm And grow like cedars of Lebanon Planted in the courts of God Forever and ever The senseless person doesn’t know The wonders of Your glory And yet their hoppers overflow But they don’t understand That folly springs up like the grass And spreads throughout these vast lands But harvesting will come to pass When everything is shown Everything will be exposed Fresh and green… It is so good to sing of You At the first light of the morning And at night Your faithfulness review Before I close my eyes And sometimes in the dimming light I stumble on Your glory That overwhelming sudden fright But not the daunting kind It’s so hard to describe.",
