We want to feel “at home” in the organizations that are part of our lives – our families, schools, communities, places of worship. We seek connection. We search for a place where we are known.\nThis sense of being “at home” is essential to our experience as learners. Deep, authentic learning happens in spaces where we feel connected with others – places and spaces where we are known. Palmer (1998) refers to this as the “spiritual quest for connectedness” (p. 5).\nIn this course, we will explore together the theoretical foundations of learning communities, evaluating key elements essential to creating authentic learning communities, where learners are known and learning is authentic. In this unit, we will engage with the writings of Parker Palmer, a teacher and writer who has written several important works regarding the essential role of authenticity in teaching and learning.\nIn addition to reading, throughout this course, we will also listen to music and view several short films that will allow us to more deeply engage with the concepts of belonging and authenticity within the teaching/learning experience.\nUnit 1 focuses on two guiding questions:",

Learning is, by definition, a transformative experience; we change as a result of learning. Teaching is also a transformative experience; we change as a result of teaching.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Authentic Learners and Authentic Teachers Model designed by Penfold Navarro, C. (2018)\nIn his book, The Courage to Teach: Exploring the Inner Landscape of a Teacher’s Life, Parker Palmer (2017) argues that the “inner landscape of teaching” is an essential foundation out of which authentic learning experiences emerge.\n\nTeachers possess the power to create conditions that can help students learn a great deal – or keep them from learning much at all. Teaching is the intentional act of creating those conditions, and good teaching requires that we understand the inner sources of both the intent and the act. – Palmer (2017, p. 7)\n\n\n1.1.1 Activity: Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we explore the importance of the “inner life of the teacher” as a foundation for authentic learning, read Chapter 1: The Heart of a Teacher: Identity and Integrity in Teaching in The Courage to Teach (Palmer, 2017). Alternatively, read If you Build Teachers, will students come? (Goode, 2007).\nFor this course, you will keep a Reflective Learning Journal, which will provide the basis for many of your blog posts. Writing can be a powerful learning experience, as we engage in reflection and critical analysis of the new concepts we discover. Through regular writing, we are challenged to think critically, organize, and integrate these new concepts with our prior understanding, as you prepare for your future teaching/coaching.\nQuestions to Consider\n\nIn your Reflective Learning Journal, write a summary sentence for each major idea/concept that relates to your understanding of what it means to be a teacher/facilitator/coach.\nChoose the concept that most resonates with you and write a short paragraph summary of this concept, applied to your professional/personal context.\nFormulate one question that emerged from this reading that you will explore and consider in future course readings and discussions.\nAs you prepare your discussions, refer to these notes.",

What elements made that learning space feel like “home?”\nIn the song, *Home**, Phillip Phillips sings about the universal need we share as humans to “belong.” Take a moment now to listen to this song, considering what the lyrics say about what it means to belong.\n\nJust know you’re not alone ’Cause I’m going to make this place your home. – Phillip Phillips,\n\nWatch: Phillip Phillips - Home\n\nIn order for students to authentically learn, we must create learning spaces that are safe, where students know and feel that they belong. Palmer (1998) refers to this need for belonging as the “spiritual quest for connectedness” (p.5).\nIf a sense of belonging provides a foundation for learning, then in our role as teachers, facilitators, or coaches, we must endeavour to create spaces where students know and feel that they belong.\n\nGood teachers possess a capacity for connectedness. They are able to eave a complex web of connections among themselves, their subjects, and their students so that students can learn to weave a world for themselves. – Palmer (2017, p. 11)\n\nBut how is this done?\nIn “To Know As We Are Known,” Palmer (1993) suggests that learning spaces must include openness, boundaries, and an air of hospitality. These learning spaces, according to Palmer (1993) can be spaces “both to be and to become” (p. 71).\n\n1.3.1 Activity: Ranking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank the following strategies according to your comfort level. For each strategy, list one practical action you can take in an online learning environment (as facilitator or learner) to create an authentic learning space that is hospitable and open.*\n“To study with a teacher who not only speaks but listens, who not only gives answers but asks questions and welcomes our insights, who provides information and theories that do not close doors but open new ones, who encourages students to help each other learn – to study with such a teacher is to know the power of a learning space” (Palmer, 1997, pp. 70-71)\n\nSpeaking\nListening\nGiving answers\nAsking questions\nProviding information/theories that open doors\nEncouraging students to help each other learn\n\nNext, read the discussion of authentic learning environments in Herrington and Oliver (2000), consider how the elements they discuss align with or differ from Palmer’s (2017) description of learning communities.\nHerrington, J. and Oliver, R. (2000).

    "section": "2.1 Belonging to Myself",
    "text": "2.1 Belonging to Myself\nIn order to create authentic, safe learning spaces for others, we must first be comfortable with who we are.\nIdentity: Knowing ourselves as teachers means that we must explore what Palmer (2017) calls the “inner landscape.” We must be aware of the character traits, personal experiences, values, beliefs, and cultural environment in which we were raised and now live. These elements are part of our identity – and we bring our identity with us into the classroom and learning spaces in which we coach and teach others (Palmer, 2017).\nIntegrity: So, too, our integrity comes with us into the learning spaces in which we teach. Integrity, from Palmer’s (2017) discussion, is not about ethics, but about an integrated sense of self – a self that is whole, integrating life experiences and values and beliefs in a meaningful, authentic way.\nWhether we are aware of it or not, our integrity and identity are part of who we are as teachers. It is on this foundation that we build connections with students, and are able to invite them into spaces where personal transformation and authentic learning will take place.\nAuthenticity is also an essential ingredient for effective leadership. Authentic leadership includes elements of both self-knowledge and identity, as well as collaboration with others within the context of relationship (Northhouse, 2019). Avolio, Walumbwa and Weber (2009) provide a model of authentic leadership that includes “self-awareness, internalized moral perspective, balanced processing, and relational transparency” (as cited in Northhouse, 2019, p. 198).\nHowever, even when we long to be vulnerable and authentic within our roles as teachers or leaders, we are often challenged by our own desire to project competence and strength, thinking that vulnerability and strength are mutually exclusive. Despite our need for authentic leaders and teachers, many of us remain reluctant to share any level of vulnerability – perhaps even more so when we are in positions of influence, as teachers, coaches, or leaders.\nIn her book, Imposter Phenomenon: When Success Makes You Feel Like a Fake, Clance (1985) argues that many of us enter the arena of public engagement and career with concerns about whether we really belong. This fear often means we are afraid that being vulnerable or authentic will reveal to others that we do not truly “belong” in our roles.\nThe first step to belonging, as seen in the work of Brown (2017) and Palmer (2017) is a sense of our own identity – including both our strengths and our areas of disconnection or discontent. Both these scholars urge us to understand our own humanity – to “learn to trust ourselves and trust others” (Brown, 2017, p. 37).\nAs poet Maya Angelou discusses, belonging to one’s self is an ongoing journey – a journey that is not always easy.\n\nI belong to myself. – Maya Angelou, 1973\n\n\n2.1.1 Activity: Who are you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this activity, you are asked to share a little more about yourself with your peers. First, find a quote about either identity or integrity. For example, you may want to perform a Google image search for “identity quote.” Find one that resonates with you, and then include a picture of something that tells us something about you. Post the quote and your image to the Unit 2 Discussion forum with a 1-2 sentence explanation. This is a non-graded activity, but may help you reflect on this topic and to prepare for the assignment in this unit.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Activity: View and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the following resources and reflect on your learning:\n\nRead. Brown, B. (2017). Chapter 1: Everywhere and Nowhere.\nWatch: Maya Angelou: Interview with Bill Moyers (7 minutes).",

    "text": "2.2 Vulnerability in Learning Communities\nLearning to be vulnerable enough to share our authentic selves can be challenging – and knowing how much to be vulnerable (and when!) also poses a challenge, both in teaching and leadership. Students also wrestle with similar questions – How much of myself should I share in this class? This paper? This blog? Is this a safe space to express my own feelings of vulnerability?\nAuthenticity is built on trust – spaces in which you are comfortable enough to share your true self – your identity. Brown (2017) argues that “self-trust” provides a foundation for belonging.\n\nAuthenticity involves both owning one’s personal experiences (values, thoughts, emotions and beliefs) and acting in accordance with one’s true self (expressing what you really think and believe and behaving accordingly) (Harter, 2002, as cited in Gardner, Avolio, Luthans, May, and Walumbwa, 2005, pp. 344-5).\n\nGardner et al. (2005) describe authentic leadership is demonstrated when “relationships are characterized by: a) transparency, openness, and trust, b) guidance toward worthy objectives, and c) an emphasis on follower development” (p. 345).\nIf effective relationships include these characteristics, then authentic teachers and leaders must consider what it means to be transparent and open, as well as what it means to extend trust.\n\n2.2.1 Activity: Vulnerability Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the TedTalk by Brene Brown: (20 minutes)\nWatch:The power of vulnerability | Brené Brown (20 minutes)\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhat elements of a learning community would create conditions for learners to be vulnerable about their fears about the course, their concerns about learning, and their questions regarding whether they are capable of achieving success in their course?\nIn what ways do you feel vulnerable as a teacher/facilitator? Are there people with whom you can share this vulnerability?\n\nYou may want to answer these questions in your Reflective Learning Journal, and refer back to them as you complete the assessment for this unit.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Activity: Brown Reading & Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown (2017) argues that authenticity is essential to belonging.\n\nYou will always belong anywhere you show up as yourself and talk about yourself and your work in a real way. – Brene Brown (2017, p. 26)\n\nAs you read Brown (2017) Chapter 2, answer the following questions in your Reflective Learning Journal:\n\nWrite a summary sentence for each major idea/concept that relates to belonging.\nChoose the concept that you would like to apply in your own learning communities, both as a student and teacher/facilitator.\nFormulate one question that emerged from this reading that you will explore and consider in future course readings and discussions.\nAs you prepare your discussion post, refer to these notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Activity: Sharing your Identity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing vulnerable involves sharing something of our true selves, which we might not always be comfortable doing in certain environments.\nIn your Reflective Learning Journal, consider a time when you were your “true self” in a professional or personal setting in which you wondered if you really “belonged.” Perhaps this is a time when shared your spoke up about an issue that was important to you, lead a team in a new direction, or created a process that felt more authentic to you. - What part of yourself did you share? - How did this make you feel vulnerable?

But the first (and perhaps most important) connections we make (and the connections on which all learning is built) are connections between students, and between students and teachers.\n\nGood teachers join self and subject and students in the fabric of life. – Parker Palmer (1998, p. 11)\n\nLeadership, like teaching, relies not just on the relationships that teachers form with learners, but also on the identity of the teacher. “Authentic leaders understand their own values and behave toward others based on these values” (Northouse, 2019, p. 201).\nThese relationships will form the basis for learning in the classroom. Learning is, at its heart, a personal activity.

One of these “Liberating Structures” is the strategy of the “Nine Whys,” which allows participants to clarify what is important in their work. You may choose to use a strategy like this in your role as a facilitator and teacher. For this learning activity, however, you will use the strategy of the “Nine Whys” to consider your own identity as a teacher/facilitator.\nIdentify someone in your life who knows you well, with whom you have a history of talking about your goals or dreams. Ask them to participate in this exercise with you.\n\nBegin by telling them why you are taking this course, as well as why you want to engage in teaching/coaching/facilitation.\nWhen you have finished talking, your “Nine Whys” partner will ask you: Why is that important to you?\nYour partner should continue asking that question up to nine times, or until you cannot go any deeper.\nAt this point, you will have uncovered something fundamental about your identity as a teacher/facilitator. As you complete this exercise, take detailed notes in your Reflective Learning Journal. You will be asked to create a discussion post about this experience in the Unit 2 Assessment.",

She contrasts a true sense of “belonging” to “fitting in” which she describes as a sense of being accepted, but not as one’s true self.\n\nWe want to be part of something, but we need it to be real – not conditional or fake or constantly up for negotiation. We need true belonging. – Brene Brown (2017, p. 31)\n\nAccording to Brown (2017), belonging involves a certain level of vulnerability, because it means we are must show up as our true selves – and those selves often include some level of doubt or weakness or insecurity.\nShe defines “belonging” this way:\n\nBelonging is the innate human desire to be part of something larger than us. Because this yearning is so primal, we often try to acquire it by fitting in and by seeking approval, which are not only hollow substitutes for belonging, but often barriers to it. Because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self-acceptance – (Brown, 2017, p. 32).\n\nPart of our role as teachers and facilitates or to foster learning communities where students can truly belong.",

    "section": "3.2 Creating Learning Spaces Where Students Belong",
    "text": "3.2 Creating Learning Spaces Where Students Belong\nLearning, by its nature, requires us to wrestle with ideas and facts and theoretical perspectives that are new or contradict our current knowledge or beliefs. Therefore, learning spaces must serve as spaces where we can be challenged by new ideas and challenge our current thinking, while at the same time feel confident that our thoughts and perspective are valued. These learning spaces must simultaneously allow us to be our authentic selves – and allow others to be authentic as well.\nBrene Brown (2017) discusses key concepts of creating spaces that facilitate a sense of belonging – including civility, inclusive language, truth, and respect. Often, the balance between truth and civility can be challenging – as we seek to authentically discuss new ideas – but in a manner that is both civil and respectful of others.\nTrust is at the heart of authentic learning communities. Brown (2017) uses the acronym “BRAVING” to describe key elements of trust. These elements include Boundaries, Reliability, Accountability, Vault, Integrity, Non-Judgement, and Generosity (p. 114).\nPalmer (2017) also argues that spaces free of fear are necessary for authentic learning. He describes a “shutdown” that occurs as we seek to protect ourselves – both teachers and students – and as we think about learning and knowing in from an either-or perspective, failing to acknowledge the great vastness of truth. Learning communities, then, must be places of trust, with a focus on learning that incorporates both “profound truth” and “paradox” (Palmer, 2017, p. 65).\nBrower and Dettinger (1998) contend that diversity of thought and perspective is an essential element of a learning community. “When we define a community as a group of individuals committed to shared values and goals, who purposefully come together and work together to reach these goals, then diversity is encouraged not just for ideological reasons but also because different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds contribute to the collaborative efforts to achieve the community’s goals” (Brower & Dettinger, 1998, p. 16).\n\n3.2.1 Activity: Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind a quiet space in your home or outdoors. Make your favourite beverage. With your iced coffee or hot tea with honey next to you, settle into a comfortable position.\nRead the poem by Rainer Maria Rilke “Ah, not to be cut off”. Sit for a moment with this poem. Re-read it. Consider the words and ideas expressed by Rilke.\nIn your Reflective Journal, jot down your thoughts. Consider how you have, in your own learning experiences, experienced “the winds of homecoming” or the desire “not to be cut off.”\n\nImage by Engin Akyurt from Pixabay\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three reading options to help you reflect on inclusive learning communities.\n\nRead: Brown (2017). Chapters 3-6.\n\n\nIn preparation for the discussion in this unit, reflect on the BRAVING checklist (p. 114).\nHow would you apply this concept in a course to create an inclusive, authentic learning community?\n\n\nRead Palmer (2017) Chapter 2. As you read, consider these questions:\n\n\nHow am I “at home in a universe that embraces both the smallness of ‘I’ and the vastness of all that is ‘not I,’”? (Palmer, 2017, p. 59).\nWhat fears do I need to overcome as a teacher so I can create space for students to express their fears?\n\n\nRead Westheimer et. al (2004) Education Leading to Good Citizens.\n\n\nHow would you apply what the authors are saying in a course to create an inclusive, authentic learning community?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Activity: Listen and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen to A Place in this World, sung by Taylor Swift.\nConsider the following scenario:\nImagine a student in a course you are facilitating. A young student submits a poorly written assignment and then does not complete the next week’s assignment. When you ask the student to meet with you, she shares this song with you and shares that she feels all alone, she doesn’t feel confident writing at an academic level, and she didn’t do this week’s assignment because she’s afraid she will fail. She thinks she probably shouldn’t have been admitted to this program.\nIn your Reflective Journal, compose an email or talking points for a conversation with the student, specifically describing why she belongs in this course.",

A learning community can be created within a specific course, academic program, or professional context. Learning communities can be found across university campuses and often include a set of interdisciplinary, paired-courses that students take as a cohort. They can be grounded in residence halls with an integration of living and learning. Or, they can be developed in formal educational environments with a focus on students learning together as a cohort. Professional learning communities have also emerged as an important force in education and other fields, as colleagues gather around a shared interest, a focus on continuous quality improvement, and a shared discipline.\nLearning communities are authentic, emotionally-safe and inclusive spaces (whether physical or virtual) where learners and teachers come together to engage in deep learning.

    "text": "4.1 Learning Community Pyramid\nThe Learning Community Pyramid, developed by Brower & Dettinger (1998) includes academic, social, and physical components. They describe academic components as those that focus on the curriculum and learning that takes place. The social components are the elements of trust and inclusivity that create space for community. The physical component is the “place or facility where the community meets or resides” (Brower & Dettinger, 1998, p. 17). In the case of this course, that “place” is the course hub.\nBuilding on the foundation of social, physical, and academic elements, Brower and Dettinger (1998) contend that learning communities also include three areas of responsibility: ethical responsibility, civic responsibility, and professional responsibility (p. 17).\nAccording to Brower & Dettinger (1998), “Learning communities, to be considered as such, must integrate academic subject matter and social interactions while providing the physical space or facility for an intellectually stimulating environment to emerge. Furthermore, learning communities must be designed to develop a triad of responsibilities within students—professional, ethical, and civic” (p. 16).\nAs you consider the learning community you will facilitate, consider how you might develop or model professional, ethical, and civic responsibility within that community. Do you think leaders should develop these same areas of responsibility with the organizations or companies they lead?\n\n4.1.1 Activity: Compare Community Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead “What IS a Learning Community?” (Brower & Dettinger, 1998).\nIn your Reflective Journal: - Write down three strengths of this learning community model. - Write 2-3 questions you have about this learning community. - Do you think this model accurately reflects the type of learning community you want to create? - Why or Why not?\nAs we compare the other two models, feel free to organize your thoughts into a chart such as the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nStrengths of model\nAspects Unique to this Model\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nLearning Community Pyramid (Brower & Dettinger, 1998)\n\n\n\n\nCommunity of Truth model (Palmer, 2017)\n\n\n\n\nTrinity Community of Inquiry (Madland, 2017)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Activity: York Reading and Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead York et.al - Defining and Measuring Academic Success (2015).

    "text": "4.2 The Community of Truth (Palmer, 2017)\nPalmer’s learning community model (2017) incorporates both learning and community with a “subject” as the center, surrounded by “knowers” who are in relationship to both each other and the subject. Palmer (2017) assets that “the community of truth, far from being linear and static and hierarchical, is circular, interactive, and dynamic” (p. 106).\n\nFigure 4.1: Palmer’s Community of Truth model.\nThe learning that takes place in this model is captured in this statement: “I understand truth as the passionate and disciplined process of inquiry and dialogue itself, as the dynamic conversation of a community that keeps testing old conclusions and coming into new ones” (p. 106).\nAs teachers, we approach teaching with some sense that we have some thing (some subject) to teach students. Palmer (2017) challenges us to think differently about the teaching/learning experience. (See “The Objectivist Myth of Knowing,” p. 103 and “The Community of Truth,” p. 105).\nInstead of solely focusing on what we must teach (and what students must learn), Palmer challenges us to consider how we all might learn something more together – more than is already known – through the teaching/learning experience. In this way, we must consider that we are not just engaged in transferring information or knowledge, but that (in addition to that), together we might create new knowledge.\n\nI know of no field, from science to religion, where what we regard as objective knowledge did not emerge from long and complex communal discourse that continues to this day, no field where the facts of the matter were delivered fully formed from on high (Palmer, 2017, p. 107).\n\nPalmer’s (2017) model highlights the relational knowledge of learning communities, underscoring not just the relationship of the people involved, but also the relationships between people and subject. As you consider facilitating learning communities, give some thought to your own relationship to the subject to be taught and learned. Consider whether you “know” this subject objectively or subjectively.\n\n4.2.1 Activity: Palmer Reading and Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead The Courage to Teach, Chapter 4 “Knowing in Community” (Palmer, 2017).\nIn your Reflective Journal: - Write down three strengths of this learning community model. - Write 2-3 questions you have about this learning community. - Do you think this model accurately reflects the type of learning community you want to create? - Why or Why not?",

    "text": "Summary\nThe learning community models we have considered in this unit share some similarities. In each model, there is an awareness that learners and learning is multidimensional. As we engage in teaching and learning, we must always be aware that the learning process is, fundamentally, transformative. It engages people, not only on an intellectual level, but also on a spiritual and social level. By designing curriculum, pedagogy, and learning around all aspects of learning – social, cognitive, and spiritual – we provide the foundation for transformational learning.\nPalmer (2017) puts it this way:\n\nThe reality we belong to, the reality we long to know, extends far beyond human beings interacting with one another… This is a community held together not only by our personal powers of thought and feeling but also by the power of ‘the grace of great things’” (p. 109).\n\nAs Palmer (2017) points out, learning includes both thought (cognitive) and feeling (social), but also something beyond those – the overarching spiritual nature of life and learning.",

    "section": "5.1 Creating Collaborative Learning in an Online Environment",
    "text": "5.1 Creating Collaborative Learning in an Online Environment\nIn our role as a teacher or facilitator, we are engaged in leading learners through a transformational educational process. “Collaborative Inquiry” is a process through which we, as educators, engage in learning about the practice of teaching through collaborative inquiry and reflection (Donohoo & Velasco, 2016).\nAthabasca University defines a Community of Inquiry as “a group of individuals who collaboratively engage in purposeful critical discourse and reflection to construct personal meaning and confirm mutual understanding” (Athabasca University, n.d.).\nWhile Collaborative Inquiry is often used to describe a process used by professional learning communities to guide organizational change – or to describe Communities of Practice among educators – collaborative inquiry is also a practice that can be implemented within classrooms.\nThe fields of Collaborative Inquiry (Donohoo & Velasco, 2016) and Appreciative Inquiry (Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010) are built on the premise that we must all collaborate together in a community of learners, and that by doing so, we can generate learning that goes beyond what we might learn on our own. It is a strengths-based approach to learning and change that has been described as “unifying moments when joy touches joy, strength touches strength, health touches health, inspiration combines with inspiration – and how to make the combinations happen more rapidly and frequently” (Cooperrider, D., as cited in Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. xiii).\nPalmer’s (2017) “Community of Truth” that we explored in the last unit, incorporates the essence of collaborative learning, underscoring the importance of relationship within education. He writes, “What seems right for me, after many years of searching, is to sit in a circle with my students (or try to relate to the crowd in a lecture hall as if we were in a circle) and lead an inquiry into the great thing in our midst, But there are other ways to create community in the classroom, and some of them look nothing like the interactive encounter we normally associate with that word” (p. 139).\nWhitney & Trosten-Bloom cast a compelling vision for collaborative environments where the act of engaging in appreciative inquiry can transform communities. They write: “Appreciative Inquiry transforms organizations into places that are free and alive, where people are eager and filled with positive power, and where the creativity of the whole never ceases to amaze, surprise, and innovate” (Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. xi). Learning communities, too, can become places that are free and alive, where all members of the community engage in challenging, authentic learning.\nAppreciative Inquiry (Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010) is built on eight principles, which can inform the way we support learners in an online learning context. These include:\n\nThe Constructionist Principle\nThe Simultaneity Principle\nThe Poetic Principle\nThe Anticipatory Principle\nThe Positive Principle\nThe Wholeness Principle\nThe Enactment Principle\nThe Free-Choice Principle\n\n(Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. 52).\n\n\n\n\n\nThese principles can serve as a guide for facilitating online discussions, designing lessons, and providing formative feedback to learners. For example, the “Simultaneity Principle” is based on the premise that by its nature, asking questions not only leads to change, but the very act of engaging in inquiry is, in fact, the first step in change. According to this principle, “the moment we ask a question, we begin to create a change” (Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. 52).\nLikewise, the “Free-Choice Principle” contends that “people perform better and are more committed when they have freedom to choose how and what they contribute” (Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. 52). Facilitating discussions that allow learners to engage in conversation (whether face-to-face or online), determine some aspects of their assignments, select topics, etc., can have a powerful influence on student engagement with learning.\n\n5.1.1 Activity: Palmer Reading and Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead: Palmer, P. (2017) The Courage to Teach, Chapter 5 Teaching in Community; Chapter 6 Learning in Community, Chapter 7 Divided No More.\nIn your Reflective Journal, make notes on the following questions:\n\nWhat specific actions could you take to invite students in to the “community of truth”?\nWhat questions can I ask to invite students to engage in collaborative, inquiry-based learning?\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Activity: AI Read and Discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview the “Principles of Appreciative Inquiry” from the Appreciative Inquiry Commons at Champlain University. (Also in Whitney & Trosten-Bloom. (2010). The power of appreciative inquiry: A practical guide to positive change.)\n\nSelect two of the Principles of Appreciative Inquiry. In a 250-word discussion post, describe a learning activity you would conduct with your class that integrates both of these principles. For example, how would you design a writing assignment that included “Positive Principle”?\nOr, describe an assignment through which you ask students to create a short video that incorporates the “Poetic Principle.”",

    "section": "5.2 Supporting Connections Between Learners",
    "text": "5.2 Supporting Connections Between Learners\nCreating a positive, open, learning environment is a critical component for fostering authentic learning – a place where we can both belong to ourselves and to others.\nBrown (2017) poses these questions:\n\nAre we willing to show up and be seen when we can’t control the outcome? Are we willing to create courageous spaces so we can be fully seen? (p. 154)\n\nPalmer (2017), offers five suggestions for ways in which we can prepare students for engagement in authentic communities – both in education, our places of work, and our communities.\n\nWe must help our students debunk the myth that institutions process autonomous, even ultimate, power over our lives.\nWe must validate the importance of our students’ emotions as well as their intellect.\nWe must teach our students how to “mine” their emotions for knowledge.\nWe must teach them how to cultivate community or the sake of both knowing and doing.\nWe must teach – and model for – our students what is meant to be on the journey toward “an undivided life.” (p. 205).\n\nIn this course, we are exploring concepts of education that include our emotional experiences with learning, the importance of community, the nature of knowledge, and the foundational importance of the teacher’s authenticity. For some academics, the acknowledgement of the emotional experience of education can be challenging, according to Palmer, who argues that the feelings we have influence our learning.\nDonohoo and Velasco (2016), in their work on Collaborative Inquiry, also underscore the importance of acknowledging the emotional experiences of student. “There is no doubt that learning is interrupted when negative emotions and attitudes surface, as such feelings hinder our ability to make sense of things” (Donohoo and Velasco, 2016, p. 36).\n\n5.2.1 Activity: View and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this activity, you will spend some time reflecting on your own experience as a learner, in order to consider the needs of the students you lead in online and face-to-face learning environments. So pick up your Reflective Learning Journal, grab your laptop, and settle down into a comfy chair (or sit among some trees).\n\nWatch: Identity by Kalhil KJ Adames (5 minutes)\n\n\n\nListen: Sara Bareilles - Brave\n\n\n\nRead: Brown (2017) Braving the Wilderness, Chapter 7 Strong Back. Soft Front. Wild Heart.\n\nJot down some of your notes describing your own identity as a student.\n\nList 2-3 times in your educational experience where you have been “brave” by sharing your thoughts or concerns in a learning environment – whether with other learners or teachers.\nList 2-3 times when you wanted to speak up, but chose instead to remain silent.\nReflect on how these actions impacted your experience as a learner. Consider what you might do, as a course facilitator, to encourage learners to speak up.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Activity: Read and Strategize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Burwell & Huyser (2013). Practicing hospitality in the classroom (available through the TWU Library.\nIn your Reflective Learning Journal, make a note of the “stances” described by the authors.

    "section": "6.1 The Impact of Identity in a Learning Environment",
    "text": "6.1 The Impact of Identity in a Learning Environment\nAn essential question for adult educators to reflect on is: What matters to me and how can my work advance this in some way? Discovering and acting upon a purpose beyond oneself brings meaning to work and can motivate learners to find meaning also. This leads to a deeper commitment and sense of fulfillment. Having a greater purpose creates unity and fights fragmentation in the activities of life. The words of Jean Vanier are a call to action for all adult educators:\n\nIt is always good for individuals, communities and indeed nations, to remember that their present situation is a result of the thousands of gestures of love or hate that came before. This obliges us to remember that the community of tomorrow is being born of our fidelity to the present. We discover that we are at the same time very insignificant and very important because each of our actions is preparing the humanity of tomorrow; it is a tiny contribution to the huge and glorious final humanity. (Vanier, 1989, p.152)\n\n\nWhat we value, we prioritize, and this directs our work and lives, shaping not just what we do but who we become. We need to start practicing now who we want to be in the future (Bregman, P., 2016).\n\nAdult educators have a privileged position in the lives of their students that can be leveraged to help them develop the skills, attitudes and dispositions they need to improve their lives and those of others. In this sense, an adult educator is a leader of self and a leader in the classroom. Who we are matters.\nFiguring out how our identity impacts the learning environment involves discerning our personal values through self-reflection. What makes us act and react the way we do? Through what screens do we view and respond to life? On what basis do we make decisions? Questions, like those in the following list (Atha et al., 2018, p. 26), can assist with the values and identity discernment process:\n\nWhat is important to me?\nWhat makes me feel fulfilled?\nWhat make me feel angry or indignant?\nWhat makes my life meaningful?\nWhat makes me feel fulfilled and gets my adrenalin flowing?\nWhat influences my decision-making process?\nHow do I like to be treated?\nHow do I treat others?\n\n\n6.1.1 Activity: Wheatley Reading and Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Wheatley, M. (2017). Who Do We Choose to Be? : Facing Reality, Claiming Leadership, Restoring Sanity. Oakland, CA: Berrett-Koehler Publishers. Opening pages 2-25; Chapters 1 (pages 28-61 and 2 (pages 63-97). As you read these pages think about a teacher, instructor or professor who is/was a leader in your eyes - someone you’ve most admired. What were their behaviours? How did you feel in their classroom? What kind of student were you, including the quality of what you produced? How do you feel about them now?\nAs you read Wheatley (2017) answer the following questions in your Reflective Learning Journal:\n\nWrite a summary sentence for each major idea/concept that relates to belonging.\nChoose the concept that you would like to apply in your own learning communities, both as a student and teacher/facilitator.\nFormulate one question that emerged from this reading that you will explore and consider in future course readings and discussions.\n\nAs you prepare your discussion post, refer to these notes.",

    "section": "6.2 The Adult Educator as Creator and Leader of a Learner Centered Learning Environment",
    "text": "6.2 The Adult Educator as Creator and Leader of a Learner Centered Learning Environment\nBeing ‘learner centered’ means teaching people not subjects. It means thinking about who is in your class, their prior knowledge about the topic, any fears or resistance they may bring to the topic and only then planning for facilitation of content. The person of the learner - not the curriculum - is the primary focus. A skillful educator however, will use the content to impact the learner and attain learning objectives. For adult educators who strive to be servant leaders, the undergirding value is human dignity, as philosopher Immanuel Kant admonishes:\n\nAct so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only. (Rachels, 1986, p. 1)\n\nServant leadership is an appropriate model for adult educators who strive to:\n\nserve others by investing in their development and well-being for the benefit of the common good. … aspire to be great only in their service to others… with integrity, humility, sincere concern, a generous, forgiving and giving heart, and self-discipline… by investing, empowering, caring for, and consulting others. (Atha et al, 2018, p. 1)\n\nThe resources you have in Brookfield, Silberman and Lipmanowiz and McCandess are learner centered in that their goal is learner engagement. Skillful adult educators try to avoid what Lipmanowicz and McCandless (2013) assert:\n\nUnwittingly, the conventional structures used to organize how people routinely work together stifle inclusion and engagement. Conventional structures are either too inhibiting (presentations, status reports and managed discussions) or too loose and disorganized (open discussions and brainstorms) to creatively engage people in shaping their own future. They frequently generate feelings of frustration and/or exclusion and fail to provide space for good ideas to emerge and germinate. (from http://www.liberatingstructures.com/home/)\n\nBy incorporating liberating structures or those suggested by Brookfield and Silberman, you will indeed avoid methods and processes that stifle. Instead, you will liberate learners to express themselves and be transformed into agents of transformation. Strategies for engagement build confidence and can have a strong, positive impact on self-efficacy and identity in the sense of empowering learners to take action. As an adult educator you have a role of equipping leaders – whether for self-leadership or leadership with others. This broader view of the role can also be purpose-filled and motivating so embrace and enjoy it!\n\n6.2.1 Activity: Strategies for Supporting Learners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe belief in technology to fix the messes we’ve made and to save us from decline has been labeled by Ronald Wright, ‘The Progress Trap’ (Wheatley, p. 41).\n\nWheatley’s point is that an over-reliance on technology is not helpful in the creation of an adult learning environment. What is then?\nBrowse through the Brookfield, Silberman texts and the Liberating Structures website. Jot down in your journal what actions and strategies (whether technology-oriented or not) an adult educator can choose, to support and focus on people and relationships in a technologically-driven world.",

What will be important for you to understand about this group in order to teach authentically in that space? What indigenous perspectives need to be considered? Consider how your own identity impacts your ability to interact in this space.\nOption B\nExplore the concept of Assimilation.\nHave you ever tried to hide your home language, religion or any other aspect of your family’s culture from your friends or classmates? If so, why? Describe the experience, how it felt, and what, if anything, about the situation you would change if you could.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease submit your assignments in the appropriate dropbox in Moodle. See the Assessment section for the Grading Criteria that explains how your assignments will be evaluated.",
