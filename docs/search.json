    "text": "Overview\nAs humans, we long for authenticity in our relationships. We want to feel “at home” in the organizations that we are part of—our families, schools, communities, places of worship. We seek connection. We search for a place where we are known.\nThis sense of being “at home” is essential to our experience as learners. Deep, authentic learning happens in spaces where we feel connected with others—places and spaces where we are known. Palmer (2017) refers to this as the “spiritual quest for connectedness” (p. 5).\nIn this course, we will explore together the theoretical foundations of learning communities, evaluating key elements essential to creating authentic learning communities, where learners are known and learning is authentic. Our hope is that, in this course, together we will expand our expertise in creating authentic learning communities, where all learners know they belong—and where all members of the learning community engage in deep learning.\nIn Unit 1, we will engage with the writings of Parker Palmer, a teacher and writer who has written several important works regarding the essential role of authenticity in teaching and learning.\nIn addition to reading, throughout this course, we will also listen to music and view several short films that will allow us to more deeply engage with the concepts of belonging and authenticity within the teaching/learning experience.\nUnit 1 focuses on two guiding questions:",

    "text": "1.2 Authenticity in Teaching and Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Teaching and learning occur in many contexts, not just in traditional classrooms. In this course the term “teaching” encompasses much more than the role of a teacher. It can include various forms of coaching, facilitation, and leadership. Consider your own experiences: whether coaching your client, facilitating a discussion, or leading a team, each of these roles embodies the essence of teaching.\n\n\n\nTeaching and learning are deeply personal experiences. Learning is, by definition, a transformative experience; we change as a result of learning. Teaching is also a transformative experience; we change as a result of teaching.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Authentic Learners and Authentic Teachers Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: From Authentic learners and authentic teachers model (Penfold Navarro, 2018)\n\nIn his book, The Courage to Teach: Exploring the Inner Landscape of a Teacher’s Life, Parker Palmer (2017) argues that the “inner landscape of teaching” is an essential foundation out of which authentic learning experiences emerge.\n\nTeachers possess the power to create conditions that can help students learn a great deal – or keep them from learning much at all. Teaching is the intentional act of creating those conditions, and good teaching requires that we understand the inner sources of both the intent and the act. (Palmer, 2017, p. 7)\n\n\n1.2.1 Activity: The Heart of a Teacher\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 60 minutes\n\n\n\nAs we explore the importance of the “inner life of the teacher” as a foundation for authentic learning, read Chapter 1, “The Heart of a Teacher: Identity and Integrity in Teaching,” in The Courage to Teach: Exploring the Inner Landscape of a Teacher’s Life (Palmer, 2017).\nAs you read, consider the following questions:\n\nWhen have you felt “at home” within a learning community?\nWhat was it about that learning experience that made you feel at “home”?\nWhat does it mean for you to be authentic as a teacher, facilitator, or leader?\nHow do we create authentic learning experiences and spaces?",

This means we must endeavour to know ourselves to create learning spaces that foster integrity in our students, clients, or team members, allowing them to authentically engage with each other, with us, and with the discipline we are studying.\nTo have integrity, we must know our own values and strengths, our own beliefs about teaching and learning, and our own perspective on the work we are doing. “If the work we do lacks integrity for us, then we, the work, and the people we do it with will suffer” (Palmer, 2017, p. 16).\n\n1.3.1 Activity: Value Sort\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 45 minutes\n\n\n\nAs a teacher, coach, or facilitator, it is important to identify and reflect on your own values.

    "text": "1.4 Creating Authentic Learning Spaces\n\n“For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known” (English Standard Version Bible, 1 Corinthians 13:12)\n\nAs we begin thinking about creating authentic learning spaces, consider a time when you have felt “at home” within a learning community, whether in formal education, your faith community, or your employment. What elements made that learning space feel like “home?”\nIn the song, “Home” (Phillip Phillips, 2012), Phillip Phillips sings about the universal need we share as humans to “belong.” Take a moment now to listen to this song, considering what the lyrics say about what it means to belong.\n\nJust know you’re not alone, ’Cause I’m going to make this place your home. – Phillip Phillips\n\nWatch: Phillip Phillips - Home (2012)\n\n\n\nFor students to authentically learn, we must create learning spaces that are safe, where students know and feel that they belong. Palmer (2017) refers to this need for belonging as the “spiritual quest for connectedness” (p.5).\nIf a sense of belonging provides a foundation for learning, then in our role as teachers, facilitators, or coaches, we must endeavour to create spaces where students know and feel that they belong.\n\nGood teachers possess a capacity for connectedness. They are able to weave a complex web of connections among themselves, their subjects, and their students so that students can learn to weave a world for themselves (Palmer, 2017, p. 11). Good teachers possess a capacity for connectedness. They are able to weave a complex web of connections among themselves, their subjects, and their students so that students can learn to weave a world for themselves (Palmer, 2017, p. 11).\n\nBut how is this done?\nIn “To Know as We Are Known,” Palmer (1993) suggests that learning spaces must include openness, boundaries, and an air of hospitality. These learning spaces, according to Palmer (1993) can be spaces “both to be and to become” (p. 71).\n\n1.4.1 Activity: Strategies for Creating an Authentic Learning Environment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 60 minutes\n\n\n\nRank the following strategies according to your comfort level. For each strategy, list one practical action you can take in an online learning environment (as facilitator or learner) to create an authentic learning space that is hospitable and open.\n\n“To study with a teacher who not only speaks but listens, who not only gives answers but asks questions and welcomes our insights, who provides information and theories that do not close doors but open new ones, who encourages students to help each other learn – to study with such a teacher is to know the power of a learning space” (Palmer, 2017, pp. 70–71).\n\n\nSpeaking\nListening\nGiving answers\nAsking questions\nProviding information/theories that open doors\nEncouraging students to help each other learn\n\nNext, read the discussion of authentic learning environments in Herrington and Oliver (2000) and Oliver et al. (2007) and consider how the elements they discuss align with or differ from Palmer’s (2017) description of learning communities.\n\nHerrington, J. and Oliver, R. (2000).

Representing authentic learning designs supporting the development of online communities of learners. Journal of Learning Design, 2(2), 1-21.\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhat are the important values that will guide my teaching/facilitation?\nWhat elements matter most to me in a learning community?\nWhat elements matter most to learners?\nWhat can I do to create hospitable learning spaces?\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Activity: Reflective Discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 75 minutes\n\n\n\nAfter completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to write in your Reflective Journal. This activity will prepare you for future activities in this course, including your final assignment. Use the following to guide your reflection and writing:\nPart 1: Incorporating the readings in Unit 1, write a 150-250-word discussion post that addresses the following:\n\nList and describe three values you hold related to teaching and learning.\nWrite a personal statement about your identity as a teacher, coach, or facilitator.\n\nPart 2: For the second part of your discussion, write a 150-250 response to the following:\n\nConsider the key elements of authentic learning spaces, outlined by Palmer (2017) in Chapter 3. Select two of these elements that you consider to be important.\nIntroduce the element and discuss some practical steps you could take to create an authentic learning space.\n\nBe sure to cite Palmer (2017) and other authors in your journal to demonstrate ways in which your thinking aligns with, contrasts with, or builds on the writing of the authors.\nNote: This activity serves as the discussion prompt for this unit. Share your response and connect with others in the Learning Community to deepen your understanding.",

    "section": "2.1 Belonging to Myself",
    "text": "2.1 Belonging to Myself\nTo create authentic, safe learning spaces for others, we must first be comfortable with who we are.\nIdentity and Integrity\nIdentity: Knowing ourselves as teachers means that we must explore what Palmer (Palmer, 2017) calls the “inner landscape.” We must be aware of the character traits, personal experiences, values, beliefs, and cultural environment in which we were raised and now live. We must be aware of our personal values, our strengths, and our weaknesses. These elements are part of our identity – and we bring our identity with us into the classroom and learning spaces in which we coach and teach others (Palmer, 2017).\nIntegrity: So, too, our integrity comes with us into the learning spaces in which we teach. Integrity, from Palmer’s (2017) discussion, is not just about ethics, but about an integrated sense of self – a self that is whole, integrating life experiences and values and beliefs in a meaningful, authentic way. When we live, teach, coach, and facilitate in a manner that aligns with our personal values and beliefs, we do so with integrity.\nWhether we are aware of it or not, our integrity and identity are part of who we are as teachers, leaders, or facilitators. It is on this foundation that we build connections with students and can invite them into spaces where personal transformation and authentic learning will take place.\nAuthenticity\nAuthenticity is also an essential ingredient for effective teaching and leadership. Authentic leadership includes elements of both self-knowledge and identity, as well as collaboration with others within the context of relationship (Northouse, 2022). Avolio et al. (2008) provide a model of authentic leadership that includes “self-awareness, internalized moral perspective, balanced processing, and relational transparency” (as cited in Northouse, 2022, p. 198).\nNorthouse (2022) describes self-awareness as a “process in which individuals understand themselves, including their strengths and weaknesses, and the impact they have on others. Self-awareness includes reflecting on your core values, identity, emotions, motives, and goals, and coming to grips with who you really are at the deepest level” (p. 227).\nThis self-awareness provides a solid foundation on which to lead. Further, the “internalized moral perspective refers to a self-regulatory process whereby individuals use their internal moral standards and values to guide their behavior rather than allow outside pressures to control them” (Northouse, 2022, p. 228).\nConnecting Values and Identity with Purpose\nWhen you know yourself and your values, you can more authentically teach, lead, or facilitate, engaging with others with integrity.\nAn essential question for adult educators to reflect on is: What is my purpose in teaching? To determine our purpose, we might also ask ourselves: What matters to me and how can my work as a facilitator and teacher advance this in some way?\nDiscovering and acting upon a purpose beyond oneself brings meaning to work and can motivate learners to find meaning also. This leads to a deeper commitment and sense of fulfillment. Having a greater purpose creates unity and fights fragmentation in the activities of life. The words of Jean Vanier are a call to action for all adult educators:\n\nIt is always good for individuals, communities and indeed nations, to remember that their present situation is a result of the thousands of gestures of love or hate that came before. This obliges us to remember that the community of tomorrow is being born of our fidelity to the present. We discover that we are at the same time very insignificant and very important because each of our actions is preparing the humanity of tomorrow; it is a tiny contribution to the huge and glorious final humanity (Vanier, 1989, p. 152).\n\nAdult educators have a privileged position in the lives of their students that can be leveraged to help these students develop the skills, attitudes and dispositions they need to improve their lives and those of others. In this sense, an adult educator is a leader of self and a leader in the classroom. Who we are matters.\nFiguring out how our identity impacts the learning environment involves discerning our personal values through self-reflection. What makes us act and react the way we do? Through what screens do we view and respond to life? On what basis do we make decisions? Questions, like those in the following list (Atha et al., 2017, p. 26), can assist with the values and identity discernment process:\n\nWhat is important to me?\nWhat makes me feel fulfilled?\nWhat make me feel angry or indignant?\nWhat makes my life meaningful?\nWhat makes me feel fulfilled and gets my adrenalin flowing?\nWhat influences my decision-making process?\nHow do I like to be treated?\nHow do I treat others?\n\nEmbracing Vulnerability to Belong\nHowever, even when we know ourselves (e.g., our values, our identity, our purpose) and even when we long to be vulnerable and authentic within our roles as teachers or leaders, we are often challenged by our own desire to project competence and strength, thinking that vulnerability and strength are mutually exclusive. Despite our need for authentic leaders and teachers, many of us remain reluctant to share any level of vulnerability – perhaps even more so when we are in positions of influence, as teachers, coaches, or leaders. We often hesitate to share anything about ourselves, even though that sharing can lead to a deeper sense of community, even if it is a small thing.\nIn her book, Imposter Phenomenon: When Success Makes You Feel Like a Fake, argues that many of us enter the arena of public engagement and career with concerns about whether we really belong. This fear often means we are afraid that being vulnerable or authentic will reveal to others that we do not truly “belong” in our roles (Clance, 1985).\nThe first step to belonging, as seen in the work of Brown (2017) and Palmer (2017) is a sense of our own identity—including both our strengths and our areas of disconnection or discontent. Both these scholars urge us to understand our own humanity—to “learn to trust ourselves and trust others” (Brown, 2017, p. 37).\nAs poet Maya Angelou discusses, belonging to one’s self is an ongoing journey, a journey that is not always easy.\n\n“You only are free when you realize you belong no place—you belong every place… I belong to myself.” – Maya Angelou, 1973\n\nWhat Angelou (1973) so powerfully portrays is that to feel like we belong to others, or in other spaces, we must first have a sense of who we are. We must first belong to ourselves.\n\n2.1.1 Activity: Who Are You?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 45 minutes\n\n\n\nFor this activity, you are asked to share a little more about yourself with your learning community. First, find a quote about either identity or integrity. For example, you may want to perform a Google image search for “identity quote.” Find one that resonates with you and then include a picture of something that tells us something about you. Post the quote and your image to the Learning Community or your preferred social network service with a 1-2 sentence explanation.\nNote: This activity serves as the discussion prompt for this unit. Share your response and connect with others in the Learning Community to deepen your understanding.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Activity: Identity, Integrity, and Belonging\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 45 minutes\n\n\n\nView the following resources and reflect on your learning:\n\nRead Chapter 1, “Everywhere and Nowhere,” in Braving the Wilderness (Brown, 2017).\nWatch “The House of Belonging” (00:50) (Whyte, 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch “A Conversation with Maya Angelous” (6:59) (Angelou, 1973).",

    "text": "2.2 Vulnerability in Learning Communities\nLearning to be vulnerable enough to share our authentic selves can be challenging—and knowing how much to be vulnerable, and when, also poses a challenge, both in teaching and leadership. Students also wrestle with similar questions—How much of myself should I share in this class? This paper? This learning community? Is this a safe space to express my own feelings of vulnerability?\nAuthenticity is built on trust—spaces in which you are comfortable enough to share your true self your identity. Brown (2017) argues that “self-trust” provides a foundation for belonging.\n\nAuthenticity involves both owning one’s personal experiences (values, thoughts, emotions and beliefs) and acting in accordance with one’s true self (expressing what you really think and believe and behaving accordingly) (Harter, 2002, as cited in Gardner et al., 2005, pp. 344-345).\n\nGardner et al. (2005) argue that authentic leadership is demonstrated when “relationships are characterized by: (a) transparency, openness, and trust, (b) guidance toward worthy objectives, and (c) an emphasis on follower development” (p. 345).\nIf effective relationships include these characteristics, then authentic teachers and leaders must consider what it means to be transparent and open, as well as what it means to extend trust.\n\n2.2.1 Activity: The Power of Vulnerability\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 50 minutes\n\n\n\nWatch the TED Talk, “The Power of Vulnerability” (20:50) by Brené Brown (2011).\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhat elements of a learning community would create conditions for learners to be vulnerable about their fears about the course, their concerns about learning, and their questions regarding whether they can achieve success in their course?\nIn what ways do you feel vulnerable as a teacher/facilitator? Are there people with whom you can share this vulnerability?\nHow can you share a bit of yourself and your life with students?\n\nNote: You may want to answer these questions in your Reflective Journal and refer to them as you complete future assignments in this course.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Activity: The Quest for True Belonging\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 60 minutes\n\n\n\nBrown (2017) argues that authenticity is essential to belonging.\n\n“You will always belong anywhere you show up as yourself and talk about yourself and your work in a real way” (Brown, 2017, p. 26).\n\nRead Brown (2017) Chapter 2 and answer the following questions in your reflective journal:\n\nWrite a summary sentence for each major idea or concept that relates to belonging.\nChoose the concept that you would like to apply in your own learning communities, as a student and teacher/facilitator.\nFormulate one question that emerged from this reading that you will explore and consider in future course readings and discussions.\nAs you prepare your first assignment, refer to these notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Activity: Sharing your Identity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 45 minutes\n\n\n\nBeing vulnerable involves sharing something of our true selves, which we might not always be comfortable doing in certain environments. This might be as simple as sharing about a meaningful experience you had with your family the previous weekend. It might mean sharing about your own challenges when you were taking your first graduate courses, or it might mean honestly responding when you don’t know the answer to a question posed by one of your students.\nIn your reflective journal, consider a time when you were your “true self” in a professional or personal setting in which you wondered if you really “belonged.” Perhaps this is a time when you spoke up about an issue that was important to you, lead a team in a new direction, or created a process that felt more authentic to you. What part of yourself did you share? How did this make you feel vulnerable? What were the results?",

    "section": "2.3 Creating Connections with Learners",
    "text": "2.3 Creating Connections with Learners\nIn our role as teachers, leaders, or facilitators, we are asked to connect students with new ways of thinking and knowing, as well as new knowledge. But the first, and perhaps most important, connections we make—and the connections on which all learning is built—are connections between students, and between students and teachers/facilitators.\n\n“Good teachers join self and subject and students in the fabric of life” (Palmer, 1998, p. 11)\n\nLeadership, like teaching, relies not just on the relationships that teachers or leaders form with learners, but also on the identity of the teacher or facilitators. “Authentic leaders understand their own values and behave toward others based on these values” (Northouse, 2019, p. 201).\nThese relationships will form the basis for learning in the classroom or learning space. Learning is, at its heart, a personal activity. Learners often experience vulnerability as they enter and continue through the learning experience, wondering if they belong, if they are up to the challenge, and if they will succeed.\n\n2.3.1 Activity: “Brave” and “Courage”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 30 minutes\n\n\n\nListen to “Brave” (3:57) (Sara Bareilles, 2013) sung by Sara Bareilles.\n\n\n\nWatch “Courage” (4:32) (Céline Dion, 2019).\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nIs there an area in my current professional work where I need to be brave and speak up?\nWhat fears would keep me from sharing my thoughts or experience?\nHow will I create a learning community that allows learners to share their thoughts authentically?\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Activity: Clance Imposter Phenomenon Test\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 30 minutes\n\n\n\nTake the Clance Imposter Phenomenon test. As you take the test, consider the areas in which you feel vulnerable in your work as a learner. How would you address these concerns for learners in courses you facilitate?\n\n\n\n\n1.

One of these “Liberating Structures” is the strategy of the “Nine Whys,” which allows participants to clarify what is important in their work. You may choose to use a strategy like this in your role as a facilitator and teacher. For this learning activity, however, you will use the strategy of the “Nine Whys” to consider your own identity as a teacher/facilitator.\nIdentify someone in your life who knows you well, with whom you have a history of talking about your goals or dreams. Ask them to participate in this exercise with you.\n\nBegin by telling them why you are taking this course, as well as why you want to engage in teaching/coaching/facilitation.\nWhen you have finished talking, your “Nine Whys” partner will ask you: Why is that important to you?\nYour partner should continue asking that question up to nine times, or until you cannot go any deeper.\nAt this point, you will have uncovered something fundamental about your identity as a teacher/facilitator. As you complete this exercise, take detailed notes in your reflective journal.\n\nNote: This activity will prepare you for upcoming assignments in this course.",

    "text": "3.1 Belonging to Others\nIn Braving the Wilderness: The Quest for True Belonging and the Courage to Stand Alone, Brene Brown (2017) discusses the universal human need for belonging – and the importance of belonging authentically. She contrasts a true sense of “belonging” to “fitting in,” which she describes as a sense of being accepted, but not as one’s true self.\n\n“We want to be part of something, but we need it to be real – not conditional or fake or constantly up for negotiation. We need true belonging” (Brown, 2017, p. 31).\n\nAccording to Brown (2017), belonging involves a certain level of vulnerability, because it means we must show up as our true selves—and those selves often include some level of doubt or weakness or insecurity.\nShe defines “belonging” this way:\n\nBelonging is the innate human desire to be part of something larger than us. Because this yearning is so primal, we often try to acquire it by fitting in and by seeking approval, which are not only hollow substitutes for belonging, but often barriers to it. Because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self-acceptance (Brown, 2017, p. 32).\n\nPart of our role as teachers and facilitators is to foster learning communities where students can truly belong.\nWhen we belong to a group, we know that we matter to the others in the group. If we engage in discussion in class, for example, we know that our ideas will be met with respect, that we will be valued for our unique contribution to our community of learning, and that we will be accepted for who we are.\nBelonging also means that we can count on others – and others can count on us. They can count on us to receive their ideas with respect, value their unique contributions to our community of learning, and accept them for who they are.\nBelonging to others is not just about fitting in, as Brown (2017) argues, but being part of a group in which we know we can fully be ourselves, and others can be fully themselves, too.\n\n3.1.1 Activity: Principles for How We Treat Each Other\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 45 minutes\n\n\n\nIn order to create a learning community in which students know they belong to others, we must consider what it means to be part of a community – and consider practical steps we can take to create those types of communities.\nRead the “Principles for How We Treat Each Other” (Peace and Justice Institute, n.d.) developed by the Peace and Justice Institute (n.d.). They have developed 13 principles that can be practiced developing authentic learning communities. Consider how you can practice these principles in your teaching:\n\nIdentify 2-3 specific actions you could take to incorporate these principles into your classroom environment, perhaps by sharing them with students in your class or training group.\nChoose 2-3 of the principles that resonate with you.",

    "section": "3.2 Creating Learning Spaces Where Students Belong",
    "text": "3.2 Creating Learning Spaces Where Students Belong\nLearning, by its nature, requires us to wrestle with ideas and facts and theoretical perspectives that are new or contradict our current knowledge or beliefs. Therefore, learning spaces must serve as spaces where we can be challenged by new ideas and challenge our current thinking, while at the same time feel confident that our thoughts and perspective are valued. These learning spaces must simultaneously allow us to be our authentic selves – and allow others to be authentic as well.\nAuthentic learning communities include several elements that are important if we want students to know they belong and that their voice and ideas matter.\nSpeaking Authentically. Listening Deeply.\nBrene Brown (2017) discusses key concepts of creating spaces that facilitate a sense of belonging – including civility, inclusive language, truth, and respect. Often, the balance between truth and civility can be challenging – as we seek to authentically discuss new ideas – but in a manner that is both civil and respectful of others.\nTrust\nTrust is at the heart of authentic learning communities. Brown (2017) uses the acronym “BRAVING” to describe key elements of trust. These elements include Boundaries, Reliability, Accountability, Vault, Integrity, Non-Judgement, and Generosity (pp. 113-114). She argues that these elements are essential to practicing civility, and that we must know ourselves if we want to create authentic communities – whether at work or in the classroom.\nTrust is an essential component of deep learning and thus must be an essential component of an authentic learning community. Palmer (2017) also argues that spaces free of fear are necessary for authentic learning. He describes a “shutdown” that occurs as we seek to protect ourselves – both teachers and students – and as we think about learning and knowing in from an either-or perspective, failing to acknowledge the great vastness of truth. Learning communities, then, must be places of trust, with a focus on learning that incorporates both “profound truth” and “paradox” (Palmer, 2017, p. 65).\nDiversity of Thought and Perspective\nWe often discuss the value that diversity brings to organizations, including the value of bringing diverse perspectives and ideas to solving the challenges we face. The same is true in learning communities. An openness to ideas that challenge our thinking is foundational to learning, and thus engaging with diverse ideas and perspectives is an essential component of the learning process. Brower and Dettinger (1998) contend that diversity of thought and perspective is an essential element of a learning community. “When we define a community as a group of individuals committed to shared values and goals, who purposefully come together and work together to reach these goals, then diversity is encouraged not just for ideological reasons but also because different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds contribute to the collaborative efforts to achieve the community’s goals” (Brower & Dettinger, 1998, p. 16).\n\n3.2.1 Activity: Ah, Not to Be Cut Off\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 30 minutes\n\n\n\nFind a quiet space in your home or outdoors. Make your favourite beverage. With your iced coffee or hot tea with honey next to you, settle into a comfortable position.\nRead the poem by Rainer Maria Rilke (2017) “Ah, not to be cut off”. Sit for a moment with this poem. Re-read it. Consider the words and ideas expressed by Rilke.\n\nIn your reflective journal, jot down your thoughts. Consider how you have, in your own learning experiences, experienced “the winds of homecoming” or the desire “not to be cut off.”\nImagine your students entering your class on the first day. Consider how you can make them feel at home.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Activity: BRAVING Checklist\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 90 minutes\n\n\n\nRead Chapters 3-5 in Braving the Wilderness (Brown, 2017).\nReflect on the BRAVING checklist (p. 113-114) and write a 250-word journal entry that includes the following:\n\nA description of each element of the checklist, and\nA 2-3 sentence description of how you would apply this concept in a course to create an inclusive, authentic learning community.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Activity: A Culture of Fear\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 60 minutes\n\n\n\nRead Chapter 2, “A Culture of Fear,” in The Courage to Teach (Palmer, 2017). As you read, consider these questions:\n\nHow am I “at home in a universe that embraces both the smallness of ‘I’ and the vastness of all that is ‘not I,’”? (Palmer, 2017, p. 59).\nWhat fears do I need to overcome as a teacher so I can create space for students to express their fears?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Activity: Scenario-Based Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 45 minutes\n\n\n\nListen to “A Place in this Word” (3:20) (Swift, 2006).\nConsider the following scenario:\nImagine a student in a course you are facilitating. The student submits a poorly written assignment and then does not complete the next week’s assignment. When you ask the student to meet with you, she shares this song with you and shares that she feels all alone, she doesn’t feel confident writing at an academic level, and she didn’t do this week’s assignment because she’s afraid she will fail. She thinks she probably shouldn’t have been admitted to this program.\nNow, consider the same student. She submits a poorly written assignment and doesn’t complete the next assignment. You ask her how she’s doing, and she says fine. Would you respond to her differently? What questions could you ask to learn more about concerns she may be having? What statements could you make to demonstrate your support?\nIn your reflective journal, compose an email or talking points for a conversation with the student, specifically describing why she belongs in this course.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Activity: Belonging Learning Activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 60 minutes\n\n\n\nBased on the learning activities in this unit, create a learning activity you would use in a course that incorporates elements of belonging, discussed in the course readings and your Reflective Journal. Include the learning outcome for the activity, the learning activity, and a discussion of how the different elements of the learning activity would serve to support a sense of belonging for students.\nNote: This activity serves as the discussion prompt for this unit.

    "text": "Overview\nIn this unit, we will review several models of “learning communities” that provide visual representations of the important components of effective learning communities.\nBefore we consider the models, we first consider the wide variety of learning communities that exist in both educational and professional settings:\nA learning community can be created within a specific course, academic program, or professional context.\nLearning Communities in Higher Education\nLearning communities can be found across university campuses in various formats. One popular format, used at larger universities include a set of interdisciplinary, paired-courses that students take as a cohort. Some graduate programs admit students in a cohort, so students take courses together throughout their program. Residential learning communities are also common for those who live on campus, grounded in residence halls with an integration of living and learning.\nProfessional Learning Communities\nProfessional learning communities have also emerged as an important force in education and other fields, as colleagues gather around a shared interest, a focus on continuous quality improvement, and a shared discipline. These professional learning communities can be organized in a professional association, in which professionals within a specific field gather at specified intervals in in-person, virtual, or hybrid formats to share best practices and engage in professional development. Professional and personal learning communities have also emerged within social media and online environments, often lead by a thought leader who writes about a specific topic, and engages people in ongoing conversation about that topic.\nIn this course, we are focusing on creating learning communities (whether face-to-face or online) that are authentic, emotionally safe and inclusive, in which learners and teachers/facilitators come together to engage in deep learning.\nBy definition, a learning community includes both “learning” and “community.”\nUnit 4 focuses on the following guiding questions:",

    "section": "4.1 Learning Community Pyramid",
    "text": "4.1 Learning Community Pyramid\nThe Learning Community Pyramid, developed by Brower and Dettinger (1998), includes academic, social, and physical components. They describe academic components as those that focus on the curriculum and learning that takes place. The social components are the elements of trust and inclusivity that create space for community. The physical component is the “place or facility where the community meets or resides” (Brower & Dettinger, 1998, p. 17). Since Brower and Dettinger’s (1998) writing, of course, many of the learning communities we engage in now take place online, thus the “place of facility” may now be a virtual space. As an example, in this class, that “place” is the Moodle course.\nBuilding on the foundation of social, physical, and academic elements, Brower and Dettinger (1998) contend that learning communities also include three areas of responsibility: ethical responsibility, civic responsibility, and professional responsibility (p. 17).\nAccording to Brower and Dettinger (1998):\n\nLearning communities, to be considered as such, must integrate academic subject matter and social interactions while providing the physical space or facility for an intellectually stimulating environment to emerge. Furthermore, learning communities must be designed to develop a triad of responsibilities within students—professional, ethical, and civic. (p. 16)\n\nAs you consider the learning community you will facilitate, consider how you might develop or model professional, ethical, and civic responsibility within that community. Do you think leaders should develop these same areas of responsibility within the organizations or companies they lead?\n\n4.1.1 Activity: What is a Learning Community?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 60 minutes\n\n\n\nRead “What ‘Is’ a Learning Community?

    "section": "4.2 The Community of Truth",
    "text": "4.2 The Community of Truth\nPalmer’s (2017) learning community model incorporates learning and community with a “subject” at the center, surrounded by “knowers” who are in a relationship with each other and with the subject. Palmer (2017) asserts that “the community of truth, far from being linear and static and hierarchical, is circular, interactive, and dynamic” (p. 106). Palmer (2017) argues that when we learn together, we learn in a dynamic process, learning more together than we would if we studied alone.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: The Objectivist My of Knowing (left) and The Community of Truth (right)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: The courage to teach: Exploring the inner landscape of a teacher’s life (Palmer, 2017, pp. 103, 105).\n\nThe learning community model, proposed by Palmer (2017), focuses on the process of learning, in which dialogue and ongoing discussion deepen and enhance the learning we experience through disciplined and focused study. “I understand truth as the passionate and disciplined process of inquiry and dialogue itself, as the dynamic conversation of a community that keeps testing old conclusions and coming into new ones” (Palmer, 2017, p. 106). Together, Palmer (2017) argues, we can learn more, learn more deeply, and learn in community.\nAs teachers, we approach teaching with some sense that we have something specific (some subject) to teach students. We often focus on transferring content or knowledge from us (as teachers) to them (the students). Palmer (2017) challenges us to think differently about teaching/learning experience. (pp. 103, 105).\nInstead of solely focusing on what we must teach (and what students must learn), Palmer (2017) challenges us to consider how we all might learn something more together—more than is already known—through the teaching and learning experience. In this way, we must consider that we are not just engaged in transferring information or knowledge, but that, in addition, together we might create new knowledge.\nTo this effect, Palmer (2017) stated:\n\nI know of no field, from science to religion, where what we regard as objective knowledge did not emerge from long and complex communal discourse that continues to this day, no field where the facts of the matter were delivered fully formed from on high (p. 107).\n\nPalmer’s (2017) model highlights the relational knowledge of learning communities, underscoring the relationship of the people involved and the relationships between people and subject. As you consider facilitating learning communities, give some thought to your own relationship to the subject to be taught and learned. Consider whether you “know” this subject objectively or subjectively. Reflect on what you might learn through further dialogue about the subject you are teaching.\n\n4.2.1 Activity: Community of Truth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 75 minutes\n\n\n\nRead Chapter 4, “Knowing in Community,” in The Courage to Teach: Exploring the Inner Landscape of a Teacher’s Life (Palmer, 2017).\nIn your reflective journal, respond to the following questions:\n\nWrite down three strengths of this learning community model.\nWrite two to three (2-3) questions you have about this learning community.\nDo you think this model accurately reflects the type of learning community you want to create? Why or why not? Add your thoughts to the table you created earlier.",

    "section": "4.3 The Community of Inquiry",
    "text": "4.3 The Community of Inquiry\nOne of the learning community models that is commonly studied regarding online learning communities is the community of inquiry model developed by Garrison et al. (2000). This framework includes three important components of an authentic and meaningful online learning community: social presence, cognitive presence, and teaching presence.\n\nCommunity of Inquiry\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Community of Inquiry Framework\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Communities of inquiry in online learning (Garrison, 2009, p. 158)\n\nImportantly, the three areas of presence—social, cognitive, and teaching—are not isolated. Instead, they are interconnected, as demonstrated in the overlapping areas in the Venn diagram.\n\nSocial Presence\nSocial presence is an important element of online learning, as students seek to make connections with each other and the teacher/facilitator, as well as feel a sense of belonging or connection within the course. Garrison (2009) defines social presence as “the ability of participants to identify with the community (e.g., course of study), communicate purposefully in a trusting environment, and develop inter-personal relationships by way of projecting their individual personalities” (p. 353). The focus in this component of the community of inquiry is not on building strong relationships between people, but on forming a group identity. Group cohesion thus is an important component, as this will provide “greater capacity to communicate and collaborate” (Garrison, 2009, p. 353) which in turn leads to more productive learning. “Social presence develops incrementally that begins by focusing first on open communication and cohesion (group identity) and, over time, personal and affective affiliations (personal identity)” (Garrison, 2009, p. 353).\n\n\nCognitive Presence\nBecause our focus in learning communities is learning, we can understand the importance of cognitive presence in our learning communities. But communities of inquiry have a particular approach to learning—inquiry. This inquiry process is one in which “learners are tasked with a problem or issue and, through iteration between discourse and reflection (public and private worlds), construct meaning and confirm understanding” (Garrison, 2009, p. 353). (You may notice elements of this inquiry process in this course. We begin each unit with questions to focus your inquiry. We then encourage you to reflect [private world], before engaging in discussion or written assignments in which you share your learning with others, including your instructor).\nGarrison (2009) explains the practical inquiry model (Garrison & Anderson, 2003), including four phases:\n\nThe first phase is the recognition and definition of the problem or issue. The second phase is the exploration of the problem or issue through the gathering of relevant information and perspectives through individual searches and discourse. The third phase is making sense of the existing information with the goal to reach resolution through reflection, sharing and critically analyzing the best ideas. The fourth phase is to test the best solution through application either vicariously or directly. Inevitably, the application phase is a catalyst to restart the inquiry process again to rethink, refine or construct a better solution (Garrison, 2009, pp. 353–354).\n\n\n\nTeaching Presence\nTeaching presence captures the teacher or facilitator’s role and responsibilities within an online learning community. This presence includes three elements: “design, facilitation, and direct instruction” (Anderson et al., 2001). While we are likely familiar with direct instruction, it is important to note that this presence is not just about telling students what they need to know. Instead, elements of course and curriculum design are important components of learning communities, as teachers and facilitators must also create engaging and authentic learning experiences, as well as facilitating that learning experience. According to Garrison (2009), “Design sets the stage and the potential of the learning experience,” (p. 354) and includes the curriculum and the organizational elements of the course, such as timeline, course schedule, assignment due dates, etc.\nDirect instruction may take the form of a lecture (long or short) within a face-to-face or video classroom, through pre-recorded videos from your instructor, or through online course content developed by an instructor or subject matter expert.\nLike the other elements of “presence,” teaching presence must also consider the social and cognitive elements of the Community of Inquiry, including a focus on creating group cohesion that supports collaborative learning, and engaging students in the learning experiences.\n\n\n\n4.3.1 Activity: Community of Inquiry\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 60 minutes\n\n\n\nWatch Community of Inquiry Framework (2020).\n\n\n\nRead the following articles:\n\nCommunities of Inquiry in Online Learning (Garrison, 2009)\nResearching the Community of Inquiry Framework: Review, Issues, and Future Directions (Garrison & Arbaugh, 2007)\n\nIn your reflective journal, respond to the following questions:\n\nWrite down three strengths of this learning community model.\nWrite two to three (2-3) questions you have about this learning community.\nDo you think this model accurately reflects the type of learning community you want to create?

As we engage in teaching and learning, we must always be aware that the learning process is, fundamentally, transformative. It engages people on an intellectual, spiritual, and social level. By designing curriculum, pedagogy, and learning around all aspects of learning—social, cognitive, and spiritual— we provide the foundation for transformational learning.\nPalmer (2017) puts it this way:\n\nThe reality we belong to, the reality we long to know, extends far beyond human beings interacting with one another… This is a community held together not only by our personal powers of thought and feeling but also by the power of ‘the grace of great things.’ (p. 109)\n\nAs Palmer (2017) points out, learning includes both thought (cognitive) and feeling (social), but also something beyond those—the overarching spiritual nature of life and learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking Your Learning\n\n\n\nBefore you move on to the next unit, you may want to check to make sure that you are able to:\n\ndescribe elements of an authentic learning community.\ncompare learning community models.",

    "section": "5.1 Creating Collaborative Learning in an Online Environment",
    "text": "5.1 Creating Collaborative Learning in an Online Environment\nIn our roles as teachers or facilitators, we are engaged in leading learners through a transformational educational process. “Collaborative Inquiry” is a process through which we, as educators, engage in learning about the practice of teaching through collaborative inquiry and reflection (Donohoo & Velasco, 2016).\nAthabasca University defines a community of inquiry as “a group of individuals who collaboratively engage in purposeful critical discourse and reflection to construct personal meaning and confirm mutual understanding” (Athabasca University, n.d.).\nWhile collaborative inquiry is often used to describe a process used by professional learning communities to guide organizational change, or to describe communities of practice among educators, collaborative inquiry is also a practice that can be implemented within classrooms.\nThe fields of collaborative inquiry (Donohoo & Velasco, 2016) and appreciative inquiry (Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010) are built on the premise that we must all collaborate together in a community of learners, and that by doing so, we can generate learning that goes beyond what we might learn on our own. This also aligns with the concept of Palmer’s (2017) community of truth.\nCollaborative inquiry is a strengths-based approach to learning and change that has been described as “unifying moments when joy touches joy, strength touches strength, health touches health, inspiration combines with inspiration—and how to make the combinations happen more rapidly and frequently” (Cooperrider, as cited in in Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. xiii).\nPalmer’s (2017) “community of truth” that we explored in the last unit, incorporates the essence of collaborative learning, underscoring the importance of relationships within education.\nPalmer (2017) writes,\n\nWhat seems right for me, after many years of searching, is to sit in a circle with my students (or try to relate to the crowd in a lecture hall as if we were in a circle) and lead an inquiry into the great thing in our midst, But there are other ways to create community in the classroom, and some of them look nothing like the interactive encounter we normally associate with that word. (p. 139)\n\nWhitney and Trosten-Bloom (2010) cast a compelling vision for collaborative environments where the act of engaging in appreciative inquiry can transform communities. They write: “Appreciative Inquiry transforms organizations into places that are free and alive, where people are eager and filled with positive power, and where the creativity of the whole never ceases to amaze, surprise, and innovate” (Cooperrider, as cited in Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. xi). Learning communities, too, can become places that are free and alive, where all members of the community engage in challenging, authentic learning.\nAppreciative Inquiry (Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010) is built on eight principles, which can inform the way we support learners in an online learning context.\nThese include:\n\nThe constructionist principle\nThe simultaneity principle\nThe poetic principle\nThe anticipatory principle\nThe positive principle\nThe wholeness principle\nThe enactment principle\nThe free-choice principle\n\n(Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. 52)\nThese principles can serve as a guide for facilitating online discussions, designing lessons, and providing formative feedback to learners. For example, the “simultaneity principle” is based on the premise that by its nature, asking questions not only leads to change, but the very act of engaging in inquiry is, in fact, the first step in change. According to this principle, “the moment we ask a question, we begin to create a change” (Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. 52).\nLikewise, the “free-choice principle” contends that “people perform better and are more committed when they have freedom to choose how and what they contribute” (Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. 52). Facilitating discussions that allow learners to engage in conversation (whether face-to-face or online), determine some aspects of their assignments, such as selecting topics, can have a powerful influence on student engagement with learning.\n\n5.1.1 Activity: Community of Truth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 90 minutes\n\n\n\nRead the following chapters in The Courage to Teach: Exploring the Inner Landscape of a Teacher’s Life (Palmer, 2017):\n\nChapter 5, “Teaching in Community”\nChapter 6, “Learning in Community”\nChapter 7, “Divided No More”\n\nIn your reflective journal, make notes on the following questions:\n\nWhat specific actions could you take to invite students in to the “community of truth”?\nWhat questions can I ask to invite students to engage in collaborative, inquiry-based learning?\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Activity: Appreciative Inquiry in the Classroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 75 minutes\n\n\n\nReview the following resources on Appreciative Inquiry:\n\nIntroduction to Appreciative Inquiry (Cooperider Center for Appreciative Inquiry, 2023)\nAbout Appreciative Inquiry (Cooperider Center for Appreciative Inquiry, n.d.)\nWhat is Appreciative Inquiry (AI)? (The Center For Appreciative Inquiry, 2024)\nGeneric Process of Appreciative Inquiry (The Center for Appreciative Inquiry, n.d.)\n\nIf you would like to explore Appreciative Inquiry further, be sure to explore in The power of appreciative inquiry: A practical guide to positive change (Whitney & Trosten-Bloom, 2010).\n\nSelect two (2) of the Principles of Appreciative Inquiry.\nIn a 250-word discussion post, describe a learning activity you would conduct with your class that integrates both principles. For example, how would you design a writing assignment that included the “positive principle”? or\nDescribe an online discuss forum, through which you ask students to create a short video that incorporates the “poetic principle.”\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Activity: Appreciative Interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 120 minutes\n\n\n\nIn this discussion, you will interview a friend or colleague. Select someone who is also a coach, teacher or facilitator—or select another student. You may also choose to complete this interview with a group. By conducting an appreciative interview, you will explore strategies for creating inclusive, collaborative learning communities.\nPart 1\nRead the article, “Appreciative Interviews (AI)” (Liberating Structures, n.d.). As you read, you will see that these instructions are developed for groups. However, if you are conducting your interview with an individual, you may still find these instructions helpful.\nNext, read “119+ Appreciative Inquiry Interview Questions and Examples” (Moore, 2019).\nFirst, develop a minimum of five (5) questions to guide the interview process. The questions should be developed based on your course learning to date, and should integrate the articles, TED talks, short films, and other resources we have reviewed together. Building on your learning, develop at least five questions that you will ask another learner, to answer the guiding questions of this unit:\n\nWhat strategies invite students to engage in collaborative learning?\nWhat strategies can we use in online learning environments to support connections between students?\n\nPart 2\nThen, contact your friend or colleague and schedule a time to meet, preferably face-to-face, or through Zoom, Skype, some other form of video conferencing, or by phone.\nPart 3\nAfter you have completed the interview, prepare a 250-word reflection on what you have learned from the interview, identifying at least three strategies you can use to engage students in collaborative learning as well as strategies you can use to support connections between students in online learning environments. Be sure to reference the other learner for her/his original ideas.\nNote: This activity serves as the discussion prompt for this unit.

    "section": "5.2 Supporting Connections Between Learners",
    "text": "5.2 Supporting Connections Between Learners\nCreating a positive, open, learning environment is a critical component for fostering authentic learning – a place where we can both belong to ourselves and to others.\nBrown (2017) poses these questions: “Are we willing to show up and be seen when we can’t control the outcome? Are we willing to create courageous spaces so we can be fully seen?” (p. 154).\nPalmer (2017) offers five suggestions for ways in which teachers can prepare students for engagement in authentic communities, in education, our places of work, and in our communities.\nTeachers must\n\nhelp students debunk the myth that institutions process autonomous, even ultimate, power over our lives.\nvalidate the importance of students’ emotions as well as their intellect.\nteach students how to “mine” their emotions for knowledge.\nteach them how to cultivate community or the sake of both knowing and doing.\nteach and model for students what is meant to be on the journey toward “an undivided life” (p. 205).\n\nIn this course, you are exploring concepts of education that include our emotional experiences with learning, the importance of community, the nature of knowledge, and the foundational importance of the teacher’s authenticity. For some academics, the acknowledgement of the emotional experience of education can be challenging, according to Palmer (2017), who argues that the feelings we have influence our learning.\nDonohoo and Velasco (2016), in their work on collaborative inquiry, also underscore the importance of acknowledging the emotional experiences of student. “There is no doubt that learning is interrupted when negative emotions and attitudes surface, as such feelings hinder our ability to make sense of things” (Donohoo & Velasco, 2016, p. 36). Other scholars also argue for a more integrated approach to the teaching and learning process. “Indigenous worldviews see the whole person (physical, emotional, spiritual, and intellectual) as interconnected to land and in relationship to others (family, communities, nations)” (Cull et al., 2018).\n\nSentipensante Pedagogy\nLearning communities that support deep connections between learners, as well as reflective practice, lead us to a more integrated learning experience. According to Rendon (2014), “Our modern culture remains obsessed with separating the workings of the mind from intuition, which is unexplained knowledge achieved through breakthrough insights, often occurring through contemplative means such as dreams, mandalas, and meditation, among others” (p. 132). In an online learning environment, learners can often feel unengaged or disconnected—not just from other students or their teacher, but also from the learning themselves. Staring at a screen, instead of engaging with other human beings in the same room, we can focus on the tasks to be done, instead of the deep learning. And, of course, it is the deep learning—the reflection, the contemplation, the conversations—that are of the greatest value.\nRendon (2014) argues that we need to facilitate learning experiences that allow and encourage learners to bring their whole selves into the learning experience. She terms this teaching approach as “sentipensante pedagogy”—an approach to teaching that marries heart and mind and “represents the reunification of sensing and thinking to foster the acquisition of knowledge and wisdom (p. 134).\nThus, Rendon (2014) suggests that we create learning experiences for students that ensure “the learner is actively connected to what is being learned, and diverse forms of contemplative practice become conduits to elicit deep awareness, focus, compassion, social change, transformation, creativity, and inspiration, as well as intellectual understandings” (pp. 134-135).\nBy bringing music or poetry into the learning experience, for example, we allow students can engage with and express their emotions and learning in different ways. In this course, you may have noticed prompts that encourage you to reflect, either on academic sources or music. These are designed to deepen your opportunity to reflect and engage with what you are learning. As you reflect on your learning in this course, you may consider using some of the contemplative practices which Rendon (2014) recommends, including “stillness, movement, creation process, activist, generative, ritual/cyclical, and relational” (p. 137).\n\n\n5.2.1 Activity: Reflection on Your Own Experience as a Learner\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 90 minutes\n\n\n\nFor this activity, you will spend some time reflecting on your own experience as a learner. By remembering your own experiences as a learner, you may be able to consider the needs of the students more efficiently as you lead in online and face-to-face learning environments. So, pick up your reflective learning journal or grab your laptop, and settle down into a comfortable chair (or sit among some trees).\n\nFirst, watch “Identity SHORT FILM (Award Winning Inspirational Short)” (2012).\n\n\n\n\n\nListen “Brave” (2013).\nRead Chapter 6, “Hold Hands with Strangers,” in Braving the Wilderness (Brown, 2017).\n\nJot down some of your notes describing your own identity as a student.\n\nList two to three (2-3) times in your educational experience where you have been “brave” by sharing your thoughts or concerns in a learning environment – whether with other learners or teachers.\nList two to three (2-3) times when you wanted to speak up but chose instead to remain silent.\nReflect on how these actions impacted your experience as a learner. Consider what you might do, as a course facilitator, to encourage learners to reflect deeply about what they are learning. What could you do to create a learning environment where students know they can speak up, share their ideas, and bring their whole selves to their learning?\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Activity: Action Planning for Your Own Teaching and Facilitation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 75 minutes\n\n\n\nRead the articles while considering the reflective questions that follow:\n\nOn Online Practices of Hospitality in Higher Education (Imperiale et al., 2021)\nManaging Online Small-group Learning: Effects of Facilitation Style and Type of Group Reward (Kwok et al., 2025)\n\nIn your reflective learning journal, identity two to three (2-3) practices identified in these articles that you could use as an online instructor or facilitate collaboration between learners. Think through how you might use these practices. Then, develop a short action plan for how you could implement one or more of these practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Activity: Action Planning for Your Own Teaching and Facilitation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 75 minutes\n\n\n\n\nUnwittingly, the conventional structures used to organize how people routinely work together stifle inclusion and engagement. Conventional structures are either too inhibiting (presentations, status reports and managed discussions) or too loose and disorganized (open discussions and brainstorms) to creatively engage people in shaping their own future. They frequently generate feelings of frustration and/or exclusion and fail to provide space for good ideas to emerge and germinate (Liberating Structures, n.d.).\n\nTo create meaningful, authentic, and engaging learning experiences, you will explore Liberating Structures website and two classic resources in facilitation and adult learning—Brookfield and Preskill’s (2016) The Discussion Book and Silberman and Biech’s (2015) Active Training. These tools offer creative, research-informed ways to spark meaningful dialogue, invite every voice into the room, and design learning experiences that are dynamic, inclusive, and memorable. You will explore practical methods to move beyond lectures and PowerPoints toward interactions that truly engage hearts, minds, and hands.\nBy incorporating liberating structures or those suggested by Brookfield and Preskill (2016) or Silberman and Biech (2015), you will indeed avoid methods and processes that stifle. Instead, you will liberate learners to express themselves and be transformed into agents of transformation. Strategies for engagement build confidence and can have a strong, positive impact on self-efficacy and identity in the sense of empowering learners to act. As an adult educator you have a role of equipping leaders – whether for self-leadership or leadership with others. This broader view of the role can also be purpose-filled and motivating so embrace and enjoy it!\nExplore the Liberating Structures site and click on any structure to learn more details. Select two to three (2-3) structures that you could apply to your context. Review the two texts as well and select one to two (1-2) strategies from each book that you might consider trying. Take a moment to make some notes in your reflective journal about why you chose these structures or teaching strategies and how you could use these.",

    "text": "6.1 Building Community in Learning Environments\nAs we continue to consider how to create authentic learning communities, in this unit we will focus on strategies to build a deeper sense of community, as well as how to provide feedback to students to support their continued growth and development.\nAs facilitators of learning, we strive to create learning communities and experiences where students become deeply involved in their learning. In Small Teaching Online, Darby and Lang (2019), share stories of their own teaching, including strategies they have used to engage students in the learning process. These strategies go beyond the read-think-write formula we often see—particularly in online learning. Instead, the authors tell stories of deep engagement, including a story about create opportunities for students to think critically and communicate persuasively through the use of debate. As Darby and Lang (2019) write, students found these learning experiences valuable, sharing that “the debates we had in that class helped them to see others’ viewpoints, to consider perspectives that differed from their own – to expand their thinking” (p. 76).\nFor those learning online, of course, engagement will look different. When you facilitate learning in an online environment, you must be actively present in the discussions between students, supporting student learning by engaging their ideas and connecting with them personally. As Darby and Lang (2019) argue, “You set the tone and the example, both at the very beginning of the class and throughout the semester” (p. 86).\nIn online learning environments, students can often feel isolated—especially if the instructor has no visible presence. Darby and Lang (2019) use the analogy of a student showing up to an on campus class or to an employee training session, only to walk into an empty room with no visible instructor. Throughout the course, your presence matters. “If you students begin to feel that you are never in class, they’ll stop showing up, too, and the energy of the online learning community will take a nose-dive. It’s vitally important to be active in your class in order to help sustain the interactions in the class” (p. 87). This includes things like participating in online discussions, posting regular announcements (written or video), responding to student questions, and sharing a bit about who you are as a person.\n\n6.1.1 Activity: Building Community\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 75 minutes\n\n\n\nRead Chapter 4, “Building Community,” in Small Teaching Online (2019).\nConsider the practical strategies they recommend to connect with students and demonstrate your “instructor presence.” Choose two to three (2-3) strategies you would like to try in your own teaching or facilitation of learning.

    "text": "6.2 Providing Feedback to Support Growth and Development\nAs facilitators, teachers, and leaders, we often need to provide feedback to others. Doing so can feel challenging—especially if we feel we must critique someone’s work or guide them to change something about what they are doing. And yet, teaching and facilitation, as well as leading, require that we provide this type of feedback and guidance to others.\nBeing able to provide feedback to learners is an essential component of effective facilitation and teaching. Thus, we must develop the skill of providing feedback that combines a mix of challenge and support. We can, at the same time, guide learners to high levels of achievement, while supporting their growth and development. Thus, we must develop the skill of providing feedback that combines a mix of challenge and support. We can, at the same time, guide learners to high levels of achievement, while supporting their growth and development. We can, at the same time, point out the strengths of their work, as well as areas for growth.\n\nRethinking the Role of Feedback\nTo provide effective feedback, we need to consider our own positionality. If we enter the process of providing feedback as a judge who is evaluating a student’s achievement, we will always be able to find areas to critique—and our feedback can be perceived as critical and judgemental. When we are novice teachers, we often approach feedback this way, pointing out all the things that are wrong with a student’s work. However, this approach is not very effective. Even if accurate, by pointing out all the problems, we create a combative relationship in which we are the “expert” and the student is “failing.” (Consider, for a moment, how you have felt when teachers or leaders have approached you this way.)\nInstead, when we approach feedback as an experience designed to support student learning, we can enter the experience understanding of course the student does not yet know everything about the topic or have the skills they need to complete the assignment without error. They are, after all, in this course or training precisely because they need to learn. Thus, it is our role as the facilitator to support their learning, providing guidance and feedback along the way to support their growth and learning.\n\n\nScaffolded Feedback\nWhile we may still provide direct feedback by pointing out errors, we do so with a focus on helping them correct those errors in future assignments. This concept, referred to as scaffolding, allows students to enter into the learning process with the expectation that they will continue to grow throughout the course. Shute (2008) includes several examples of scaffolded feedback, including “models, cues, prompts, hints, practical solutions, and direct instruction” (p. 163). In your graduate courses, for example, an instructor might provide a model of an effective paper for an assignment or might give you direct instruction on how to correct your reference list to ensure it aligns with APA formatting guidelines. In other words, instead of simply saying something like “Good paper. Some problems with APA formatting,” an instructor might provide notes such as: “You’re making great progress on APA formatting. In your next paper, be sure to include the author’s last name and first initial. For example, you should format this article like this…” Formative feedback like this is affirmative and supportive, while at the same time directly correcting errors and providing guidance for how to get it correct the next time.\n\n\nFormative Assessment\nThis feedback should be timely, of course. Feedback should also be what scholars of teaching and learning describe as “formative.” In other words—feedback should be tailored to the student’s learning, giving them guidance about what they should do as they move forward, to deepen their learning and expand their skills. “What students crave, and what too often they don’t receive, is feedback specifically designed to help them get better—especially through frequent, low-stakes assessments” (Darby & Lang, 2019, p. 11).\n\n\nPeer Feedback\nBut feedback does not need to come only from the instructor; in a learning community, students can also provide feedback to each other—again, focusing on the growth and learning of their peers, not in judging their work. Online discussions allow this type of interaction to occur, as students are often asked to interact with the ideas of others, challenge their thinking, or ask questions to further their learning.\n\n\nGoal-Directed Feedback\nShute (2008) argues that learner motivation depends on alignment between a student’s learning goals and their belief that they can achieve these goals. In other words, it is important that our feedback not only supports their continued motivation, but also moves them closer to achieving the learning they hope to achieve. “Goal-directed feedback provides learners with information about their progress toward a desired goal (or set of goals) rather than providing feedback on discrete responses” (Shute, 2008, p. 161).\n\n\n6.2.1 Activity: Giving Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 75 minutes\n\n\n\nRead Chapter 5, “Giving Feedback,” and Chapter 6, “Fostering Student Persistence and Success” in Small Teaching Online (Darby & Lang, 2019).\nAs you read, consider the practical strategies they recommend providing feedback that is both timely and effective.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Activity: Formative Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 90 minutes\n\n\n\nRead Enhancing Learning Through Formative Assessment and Feedback (Thamrin & Fahri, 2024). In this book review, you will learn about strategies to provide opportunities for formative feedback provided by both students and faculty. You will also notice some important recommendations for the type of formative feedback you should not provide. As optional, if you are interested in reading more about that topic, you may choose to read the book Enhancing Learning through Formative Assessment and Feedback (Irons & Elkington, 2022) as well.\nNext, read Focus on Formative Feedback (Shute, 2008). Choose two to three (2-3) strategies you would like to try in your own teaching or facilitation of learning.

Within this type of community, learners can engage in their own learning—and contribute to the learning of others.\nAs a facilitator or leader, developing the skill of providing timely and effective feedback is important. With this skill set, you can create an environment in which those you teach or lead have the opportunity to grow and develop in their work. This focus on developing others is a key component of servant leadership.\n\nServant leaders are committed to helping each person in the organization grow personally and professionally. Commitment can take many forms, including providing the followers with opportunities for career development, helping them develop new work skills, taking a personal interest in their ideas, and involving them in decision-making” (Northouse, 2022, p. 256).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking Your Learning\n\n\n\nBefore you move on to the next unit, you may want to check to make sure that you are able to:\n\nbuild community focused on learning.\nstructure feedback to support student growth and development.",

    "section": "7.1 Ways of Knowing",
    "text": "7.1 Ways of Knowing\nAs we consider how to create authentic learning experiences, it is essential that we keep in mind that we are teaching people—not content. The learners we interact with show up to their learning experiences as whole people—and thus, we must create learning experiences that engage a wide diversity of ways of knowing.\nAs multi-dimensional human beings, we learn in many ways. We learn through language and culture, through art and music, through scientific investigation and writing and listening. Trinity Western University designs the undergraduate core curriculum around this foundational concept: that we know in different ways. In Western culture, we often prioritize certain ways of knowing over others. For example, we may believe that something learned through the scientific method over something communicated through aesthetic performance.\nMany of us are aware of the ways of knowing prioritized in traditional Western education. These can be found in TWU’s core foundations and include: academic research and writing, logical and ethical reasoning, and scientific method and lab research. With a focus on Christian liberal arts education, TWU has also included religious and spiritual thought, as well as foundations courses focused on Christian liberal arts, human flourishing, and ideas that inspire.\nIn addition to these foundational courses, additional ways of knowing outlined by Trinity include: aesthetic and performance, cultural and linguistic, experienced and embodied, historical and archival, quantitative and computational, and social and global.\nBy designing learning experiences that embed different ways of knowing, we acknowledge the full diversity of the human experience. For example, courses that integrate aesthetic knowing allow us to understand that the world around us is not fully knowable through rational thought and pragmatic analysis. For example, how does one truly know love? Or grief? Or complexity?\nTWU describes this way of knowing as follows:\n\nAesthetic and performance inquiry demonstrate to students that some forms of knowledge are best understood through intuitive, imaginative, creative, and interpretive methodologies in which makers and receivers come to insight and understanding. It affirms that the ability to understand and discern the world around us and our place within it is conditioned not only by the intellect, but also by the senses—the science of sensory knowledge and the appreciation of the beautiful playing a critical role in human experience. It teaches students that the aesthetic dimension of life ensures meaning and value in ways distinct from rationalism, pragmatism, and mechanism. Experiencing and reflecting on an art form cultivates abilities that can enhance and be valuably applied to other ways of learning and modes of inquiry (TWU, n.d.).\n\n\n7.1.1 Activity: Core Ways of Knowing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 30 minutes\n\n\n\nReview the “Core Ways of Knowing” (TWU, n.d.). Choose one of the six ways of knowing that interests you. Design an in-class learning experience or assignment that would allow you to integrate this way of knowing. As you write the instructions for the learning experience or assignment, be as specific as possible. Add enough details that someone else could pick up your instructions and facilitate that learning experience.\nNote: This learning activity will help you prepare for the next assignment.\n\n\n\nBeyond Scientific Reasoning\nBy expanding our learning experiences to include diverse ways of knowing, we can not only deepen student engagement, but also deepen student learning. After all, perception based on scientific understanding is not the only way of knowing. Wheatley (2017) admonishes, “There are other ways of knowing reality, reliable methods that have served humans and earlier hominids for millennia. It is the arrogance of our science that denies their existence and their usefulness” (p. 179).\nBeyond the conceptual idea of ways of knowing, it is important to consider howe we, as adult educators can incorporate other ways of knowing into the learning experiences we design.\nCahalan (2016) has identified eight ways of knowing that are essential to wise practice:\n\nSituated awareness is noticing and describing contextual factors.\nEmbodied realizing is developing skilled competence in bodily action.\nConceptual understanding is comprehending and remembering key information.\nCritical thinking is analyzing and evaluating concepts and actions.\nEmotional attunement is identifying and using awareness of feelings and affective states.\nCreative insight is developing imaginative and creative responses.\nSpiritual discernment is perceiving what is of God and not of God.\nPractical reasoning is problem-solving, forming judgments, gaining a sense of salience, and acting wisely.\n\nThese ways of knowing are another way to consider the process and experience of learning, beyond simply reading and writing. An assignment that incorporates music, for example, might allows students to experience emotional attunement. An assignment that asks a student to create learning activities that focus on ways of knowing (as you are being asked to do in this course), might require the student to use creative insight and imagination.\nAs an education, when you choose texts, articles, music, or poems, this determines the extent to which students experience the full range of knowing in their learning. The resources you select also determine the type of information students pay attention to.\nEmbodied realizing in the classroom may take the form of an experiential learning activity where the students are asked to interview someone, ‘shadow’ them for a time or listen to a podcast and describe their ‘gut reactions’ or impressions. Reading biographies is an excellent way for learners to become more emotionally attuned to the feelings and affective states of others. This develops empathy—a crucial component of being hospitable in a diverse, pluralistic society.",

    "section": "7.2 The Adult Educator as Servant Leader",
    "text": "7.2 The Adult Educator as Servant Leader\nServant leadership requires a strong orientation to values that allow adult educators to know, care about, and serve their learners well. Since beliefs, influenced by context and culture influence decision making, expectations and emotions, it matters greatly what leadership model you adhere and aspire to. What we value, we prioritize and this shapes our work and lives.\nBy way of example of what servant leadership can look like as an adult educator, I share part of my own journey with you. As a Canadian educator, one key challenge I face is the mandate to Indigenize the curriculum. This is part of a broader call to educational leaders to work toward healing and reconciliation. In Canadian history, education was used as a tool of assimilation to extricate children from their culture and language. A statement of the Aboriginal Healing Foundation (2010) succinctly summarizes the gravity of this call to action:\n\nNo other population group in Canada’s history has endured such a deliberate, comprehensive, and prolonged assault on their human rights as that of Indigenous people. Yet, despite growing recognition of past wrongs, many Canadians remain unaware of the full scope of these injustices or their impacts. (p. 35).\n\nDr. Adrienne Castellon, an original author of this course, shared her reflections on the process of learning about and integration Indigenous perspectives into her teaching and learning.\nMore than a political mandate however, educators need to realize our moral responsibilities to relate accurately and acknowledge fully the nation’s regrettable past. I propose that the effort educators in Canada are undergoing requires servant leadership dispositions. For me, this has been, and continues to be, a process of developing knowledge of my own ignorance, discovering my own prejudices and myths and having the courage to change views and practices. It has required the disposition to work through intellectual and emotional complexities that have caused confusion and frustration. But I am willing to be disturbed and unsettled. As I strive to live servant leadership principles, approach this challenge with intellectual humility, curiosity and respect for all people which has taken much of the fear of ‘doing it wrong’ away (Castellon, n.d.).\nOur world is in need of adult educators who strive to live servant leadership principles in their practice. The resulting wideness of spirit dedicated toward the welfare of others is magnanimity—what Aristotle called the crowing virtue in his hierarchy of virtues. The adult educator has an important role in creating a more peaceful world through education that serves people and influences others to do the same.\nFor more information about servant leadership, please see the resource section for this unit.\n\n7.2.1 Activity: Servant Leadership Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 30 minutes\n\n\n\nWatch “Servant Leadership: How a Jar Can Change the Way You Lead and Serve” (TEDx Talks, 2017). As you watch the video, consider how assumption and perceptions may impact your role as an adult educator? How are adult educators servant leaders?\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider:\n\nHow are you going to live out the seven concepts of intentional practice Frett outlines? List each of the concepts and how you could live each one.\nReference the Brookfield and Preskill (2016) and Silberman and Biech (2015) and find one (1) strategy to apply to each of the seven (7) concepts. List each concept of intentional practice and your chosen strategy beside it, include a brief description of the strategy.\nIn a general manner, explain how to use the strategies with intentionality to be a servant leader in the adult learning environment.\n\nNote: This activity serves as the discussion prompt for this unit. Share your response and connect with others in the Learning Community to deepen your understanding.",

    "section": "8.1 Theories Guiding Adult Learning",
    "text": "8.1 Theories Guiding Adult Learning\nTo guide our work, we draw on three foundational adult learning theories. Understanding these frameworks helps us see why the principles of adult learning exist and how they can be applied in real-world teaching and training contexts.\n\nAndragogy (Knowles, 1980)\nKnowles’ (1980) theory of andragogy emphasizes the distinct characteristics of adult learners. Simply put, adults learn differently than children do—so we need to teach differently, too. Knowles (1980) proposed that adults are self-directed and expect to take responsibility for their learning. They want learning experiences that allow them to use what they already know and apply it to problems that need to be solved. Adults are more self-directed in their learning—they can identify skills or concepts they want (or need) to learn and seek out that learning.\nThink, for example, about a time when you ran into a challenge using Microsoft Word or another software system. You likely sought out some kind of solution—asking a co-worker for help, searching out solutions online, calling your IT help desk, or asking artificial intelligence (AI) for assistance. In other words, you identified a problem you needed to solve and were self-directed in solving it, using your prior experience to guide you.\nWith this theory, Knowles (1980) suggests that those teaching adults must acknowledge how adults learn and teach accordingly.\n\n\nExperiential Learning (Kolb, 1984)\nKolb’s (1980) model of experiential learning is built on the theory that we learn through experiences. Kolb (1980) identified a four-stage learning cycle: concrete experience (feeling), reflective observation (reflecting), abstract conceptualization (thinking), and active experimentation (acting).\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Kolb (1984)’s Learning Cycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Created by R. Kang and TWU. Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.\n\nKolb (1984) emphasized that learning never ends—that we continue to experience life and continue to learn from life—in our professional, personal, and community life. For example, if we think about software again, we can quickly understand that our learning is greatly enhanced when we engage in experiential learning. We might have someone demonstrate a software to us, but if we can follow along with the demo, selecting the items they suggest, and working through the steps to achieve what we’re trying to accomplish or create, we are more likely to remember how to complete the software task later. By practicing while we are learning, we have more sustained learning.\nFor further reference, read “What Is Experiential Learning?” (Institute of Experiential Learning, 2025), which illustrates experiential learning theory from its foundational propositions to its applications. Be sure to watch the video, This is Experiential Learning (2020) in the link above.\nAs you engage with the content, reflect on the following questions:\n\nWhat are the six propositions that the theory was built on, which are shared by the foundational scholars?\nWhat are the four step of the experiential learning cycle that David Kolb described as the ideal process of learning?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransformative Learning (Mezirow, 1997)\nMezirow’s (1997) transformative learning theory focuses on how learners critically reflect on their assumptions and beliefs, leading to a profound shift in perspective. This process involves recognizing and challenging one’s own assumptions, engaging in discourse to validate new perspectives, and integrating these insights into one’s worldview. Mezirow (1997) argued that transformative learning is essential for personal development and for fostering a more inclusive and open-minded society.\nImagine someone who has always formatted documents in Word using only the toolbar buttons they know. They assume that’s the “right” way. In a workshop, they learn about styles and themes, which makes formatting faster and more consistent. Reflecting on their old approach, they realize there is a better way. By trying it out and discussing with peers, they start to shift their perspective—what once seemed like the only way is replaced by a more efficient, intentional approach. Even a simple task becomes a transformative learning experience when learners reflect, experiment, and integrate new understanding into their practice.\nTaken together, these three theories—Knowles’ andragogy, Kolb’s experiential learning, and Mezirow’s transformative learning—illustrate that adult learning is active, reflective, and deeply connected to experience and context. These theories provide a lens for understanding how adult learners engage, apply, and integrate new knowledge, and they help us see the importance of designing experiences that are relevant, meaningful, and collaborative.\nWith this foundation, we can now explore Knowles’ (1980) Principles of Adult Learning, which translate these theories into practical strategies for creating authentic, engaging, and effective learning experiences for adult.",

    "section": "8.2 Principles of Adult Learning",
    "text": "8.2 Principles of Adult Learning\nAdult learners bring a wealth of experience, insight, and perspective to their learning experiences. (Just think for a moment the rich experience you bring to your graduate studies!) Understanding how adults learn allows us to design experiences that are motivating, effective, and resonant.\nKnowles (1980) designed what he termed the principles of andragogy, encouraging instructors to consider that adults learn in different ways than children, and advocating that we change our approach to teaching so we can support adult learners more effectively in their learning.\nKnowles (1980) presented these principles of adult learning that can guide your practice:\n\nNeed to know: Adults need to understand why they are learning something before they invest time and energy (Knowles, 1980). As you design learning experiences, think about how you can clarify the purpose and relevance of each learning experience.\nSelf-directed learning: Adults often take responsibility for their own learning (Knowles, 1980). Think about how you might offer choice and autonomy, creating spaces where learners can engage in ways that feel authentic and personally meaningful.\nRelevance and application: Adults are deeply motivated when learning feels purposeful and connected to their work or life (Knowles, 1980). As you design learning experiences, consider how learners can immediately apply new knowledge or skills in ways that make a tangible difference.\nBuilding on experience: Every learner arrives with prior knowledge and lived experiences. With adult learners, that experience is vaster (Knowles, 1980). We’ll explore strategies to connect new learning to what participants already know, so learning becomes a dialogue rather than a one-way transmission of information.\nProblem-centered and goal-oriented: Adults often prefer learning that is focused on solving real challenges (Knowles, 1980). You will practice designing authentic, problem-centered activities that reflect real-world contexts and invite active participation (Knowles, 1980).\nInternal motivation: Internal motivation often drives adult learning more than external rewards (Knowles, 1980). Together, we’ll consider strategies to foster intrinsic motivation, using reflection, dialogue, and collaborative inquiry to deepen engagement.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Knowles (1980)’s Adult Learning Principles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Created by R. Kang and TWU. Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.\n\nThese principles of adult learning can be applied in real-world teaching and training contexts. In particular, creating authentic learning communities relies on recognizing that adult learners are self-directed, bring rich prior experiences, and are motivated when they believe what they are learning is relevant to their goals (Knowles, 1980). By grounding our design and facilitation in these principles, we can cultivate learning environments where learners actively engage, share knowledge, collaborate meaningfully, and co-construct knowledge together. These theories provide a lens to help us intentionally design experiences that foster connection, reflection, and growth within authentic learning communities.\nKnowles (1980) states that adult learning is purposeful, experiential, and grounded in the learner’s context. As facilitators, we can create meaningful learning experiences by honoring learners’ autonomy, building on their prior knowledge, connecting learning to real-world goals, and fostering intrinsic motivation. Applying these principles thoughtfully helps us design experiences that engage, challenge, and empower adult learners.",

    "text": "8.3 Adult Education Methods to Teach from Depth\nWhat does it mean to teach from depth? It connects to the principle of adult learning that adults are internally motivated and build on prior life experience when they learn. Motivation is tapped into and amplified through reflective techniques and critical discussions that help the adult make sense of the new learning and situate it into what they already know. Asking thoughtful questions can lead this inquiry so that the learner constructs their own meaning. The facilitator of adult learning recognizes what Fenwick (2010) refers to as ‘the mess’ of learning and therefore strategically employs different levels of learning, making connections and establishing networks of information, while being aware of context and power dynamics.\nTeaching from depth means nurturing and valuing self-awareness, committing to self-reflection and mindfulness and practicing teaching from depth. This last point is important to balance reflection and introspection with action. Ibarra (2015) refers to this as ‘outsight’ (in contrast to insight) and argues that direct experiences and experimentation are important to develop external perspective. In the context of facilitating adult education, this means trying out various strategies and learning through trial, error, refinement and adjustment. Where internal knowledge, past experience and thinking contribute to insight, external knowledge, new experience and acting contribute to outsight. Teaching from depth involves developing insight and outsight—through utilizing both reflective practices and strategies and experiential learning.\nOne strategy that can be used to teach for depth is called “Stanislavski’s Magic If” (Schuyler et al., 2014, p. 204). Stanislavski introduced method acting in the early twentieth century. This method, often referred to as role play, is where actors draw from their own life experiences to produce truthful actions and emotions. In the context of adult education, this method can be used by creating learning experiences in which adult learners engage in role plays, analyze case studies, or explore scenarios. Through this process, adult learners can connect course content with their life experience, to apply solutions to real-world challenges. This technique is often applied in the classroom through case studies. Providing the opportunity to bridge the learner’s life experiences and course learning, challenging the learner to construct and integrate new meaning while being solutions-focused.\nBrookfield and Preskill’s (2016) The Discussion Book, which was used as a learning resource in LDRS 627, includes several strategies that foster teaching for depth including:\n\nSnowballing (p. 49),\nCritical Incident Questionnaire (CIQ) (p. 59),\nNominating Questions (p. 77), and\nWriting Discussion (p. 157).\n\nWe encourage you to review these strategies. Consider how you could use these strategies to expand your teaching effectiveness.\n\n8.3.1 Activity: Personal Values and Adult Learning Principles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 120 minutes\n\n\n\nThis activity helps you surface your own values about teaching and learning and then connect them to foundational principles of adult learning.\n\nPersonal Reflection\n\nWrite down five to six (5–6) words, phrases, or short sentences that describe what you value most in teaching and learning.\nThink back to meaningful learning experiences in your own life: What made those experiences powerful (or not)?\n\nCompare to Adult Learning Principles\n\nReview the principles of adult learning covered in this unit\nCreate a side-by-side comparison:\n\nIn one column, list your values.\nIn the other, note where your values align with (or diverge from) adult learning principles.\n\n\nMini-Reflection Journal (½ page)\n\nWhich of your values feel reinforced by adult learning theory?\nWere there any surprises or points of tension?\n\n\nNote: This activity will prepare you for the final assessment in this course, in which you will write a personal Platform of Beliefs about adult teaching and learning.\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Activity: Workplace ‘Learning’ and Adult Education\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 60 minutes\n\n\n\nRead “Workplace ‘Learning’ and Adult Education: Messy Objects, Blurry Maps and Making Difference” (Fenwick, 2010).\nNow that you reflected on your own beliefs and compared them with adult learning theory, this activity invites you to broaden your perspective. You read about eight different ways learning is understood in workplace contexts (Fenwick, 2010, p. 81) and begin shaping belief statements that will support your platform of beliefs that you will design for your final assignment.\nConsider how these categories connect with the adult learning principles you looked at in your website analysis assignment.\nRead with curiosity. As you read the article, highlight or note:\n\nhow “learning” is described or conceptualized in different workplace contexts\ndifferent models (or “ontologies”) of learning you notice (e.g., individual acquisition, co-participation, collective sense-making)\nhow power, culture, and context are woven into these ideas\nexamples or practices that seem relevant to your own teaching beliefs\n\n\n\n\nConnect to Your Beliefs\nBased on your reflection and discussion, draft two to three (2–3) belief statements about adult teaching and learning that could become part of your Platform of Beliefs. For each statement consider:\n\nHow does this belief connect to the article’s ideas?\nWhat does this belief imply for how I should design a learning experience for adult learners?\n\nIn this activity, this is the time to play with ideas and see how they evolve. You do not have to submit your platform of beliefs yet, so take some time to explore these ideas and reflect on what matters most to you. Through this process, you will be able to design more authentic beliefs, and prepare yourself to design authentic learning experiences.\n\n\n\n8.3.3 Activity: Role Play\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 30 minutes\n\n\n\nPractice using role play by planning a teaching and learning activity that utilizes it. Consider a discipline of interest to you or a concept of leadership that you want students to engage with further. Sketch out the directions to your future class for a role play activity. Alternatively, you may want to practice role play with a colleague, family member, or friend. Select a topic, such as belonging or community, and develop a role play to teach that concept within an online or face-to-face learning environment. Consider what you want the participants to learn (learning outcomes) from this role play.\nThrough this activity, you will prepare for your final assignment, in which you will design an adult learning experience that reflects adult learning theory, culturally inclusive practices, and Indigenous ways of knowing.",

    "section": "8.4 Web of Relationships and Impact on Values",
    "text": "8.4 Web of Relationships and Impact on Values\nAs we reflect in this course on our values and beliefs about adult learning, one of the ways we form our values is through our connections with others.\nWe are who we are partly because of who we associate with. Perhaps you remember your parents cautioning you to choose your friends wisely. Perhaps you are a parent who understands this and has given similar advice to your own children. Even the contemporary business literature recommends that as adults we are aware of whom we choose to associate.\nIn her book Executive Presence, Sylvia Ann Hewlett (2014) emphasizes how connections are fostered through eye contact, ‘commanding a room’ and ‘right-sizing your reputation.’ To deepen gravitas, the chief component of executive presence, she suggests “living intentionally, guided by a set of values… surround[ing] yourself with people who are better than you… [and] empower[ing] others’ presence to build your own” (Hewlett, 2014, pp. 40-41). Our interconnectedness and relationships incrementally construct a living, learning, self-organizing group or organization (Wheatley, 2017, pp. 226–240). Wheatley (2017) encourages us to prioritize collaboration, belonging, and community. As adult educators and servant leaders, we should heed this call to action for the benefit of our learners.\nWho we associate with impacts our values and our values have the potential to impact those with whom we associate. Being reliable and consistently following through on commitments is a foundational value that impacts and is impacted by the web of relationships we encounter in our work and life in general. Botelho et al. (2017) did a ten-year study in which the identified specific attributes of high-performing CEOs. I would suggest that one of the attributes in particular can also describe high-performing adult educators and learners, that is, ‘delivering reliably’ (p. 10): “The ability to reliably produce results was possibly the most powerful of the four essential CEO behaviors.” (I encourage you to read the article “What Sets Successful CEOs Apart” to learn more about the other essential behaviors for CEO success: deciding with speed and conviction, engaging for impact and adapting proactively.)\nConsider how your values are impacted by your associates and how your values impact others. Wheatley (2017) emphasizes the power of this network: “people adopt the mores of a culture, even those that contradict their personal values. The culture is in control, and most people unconsciously adapt” (p. 229). She encourages us to be conscious in our rebellion and reclaim life-affirming identities by being “fully engaged, carefully observing what’s going on as we do our work, learning from experience, applying those learnings, adapting, changing” (p. 231). How might you foster life-affirming identities in your particular learning environment?\n\n8.4.1 Activity: Interconnectedness and Relationship Networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 150 minutes\n\n\n\nRead Chapter 6, “Interconnectedness,” in Who Do We Choose to Be: Facing Reality, Claiming Leadership, Restoring Sanity (Wheatley, 2017).\nAs you read this chapter, think about Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s comment: “We exist in a bundle of life. We say, ‘A person is a person through other people.’ It is not ‘I think therefore I am’ [but rather] I am human because I belong. I participate, I share” (as cited in Wheatley, 2017, p. 223).\nBased on the reading, reflect on the following questions:\n\nWho has influenced you to become the person you are? Who do you depend on as ground and support for your life?\nDemonstrate your network of relationships and annotate with the key values or wisdom you have learned from each person.\nBecause of the influence of these individuals on your values, choose two strategies from Brookfield and Preskill (2017) and Silberman and Biech (2015) and show how they align with these values. (Choose strategies not previously described in your response.)\n\nCreate a concept map to show your networks of relationships using tools such as bubbl.us or popplet.com, or on paper, take a picture and include it in your post. Reflect on how this relates to your teaching and facilitating work.\nNote: This activity serves as the discussion prompt for this unit. Share your response and connect with others in the Learning Community to deepen your understanding.\n\n\n\n\n8.4.2 Activity: Reflecting on your Beliefs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 90 minutes\n\n\n\nIn your first reflection, you drafted some initial beliefs about teaching and facilitating adult learners. Now, you will deepen those beliefs by engaging with additional big ideas we’ve learned in this course—such as the importance of relationships in identifying our values to us, as well as adult learning theory. This activity helps you see how relationships—between you and your students, among students, and between students and the course content—shape the learning experience.\n\nReview key concepts: Take a moment to review these ideas from this course.\n\nTeacher authenticity and its influence on learning\nCulturally responsive teaching practices\nIndigenous ways of knowing and their contributions to authentic learning communities\n\nRevisit your draft beliefs: Look back at your draft belief statements from the learning. activity. For each belief, ask: How does this belief connect to (or get challenged by) these frameworks (listed above)?\nRefine and expand: Revise your belief statements so that each one:\n\nreflects your values,\naligns with (or thoughtfully resists) adult learning theory, and\nengages with authenticity, culturally responsive teaching, and Indigenous ways of knowing.\n\nShare Your Beliefs\n\nShare one belief statement with a peer in this course, a professional colleague, or someone you are close to. Ask them whether this belief reflects who you are, authentically. Ask yourself if this statement clearly connect values, theory, and course content. Then consider: what could make it stronger?\n\nReflective Journal: In your reflective journal, write one-half to one (½-1) page of notes so you can look back at this activity when you are writing your final paper.\n\nList the beliefs.\nWhich beliefs feel most central to your emerging Platform of Beliefs about adult teaching and learning?\nHow would these beliefs shape the way you facilitate authentic learning communities in the future?\n\n\nNote: This activity prepares you for the final assignment in this course, in which you will design a Platform of Beliefs about adult teaching anear learning.",

You have also engaged in reflection and begun to draft your platform of beliefs about adult teaching and learning. So much of the global culture is superficial. We send quick text messages, we get our news in sound bites and we have become experts at multi-tasking to the point of distraction. As adult educators we can and need to go deeper with our learners by being grounded in who we are and by designing learning that privileges collaboration, values and systems leading to growth and transformation. When we are intentional about doing this, we develop our web of interconnectedness and strengthen our personal and professional integrity. Powerful, indeed!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking Your Learning\n\n\n\nBefore you move on to the next unit, you may want to check to make sure that you are able to:\n\ndescribe core principles of adult learning theory, including Mezirow’s Transformative Learning Theory and Knowles’ Adult Learning Theory (Andragogy).\ndraft beliefs about teaching and facilitating adult learners, forming the foundation of your platform of beliefs.\nreflect on how relationships, values, and theoretical frameworks shape your approach to teaching and facilitation in organizational and educational contexts.",

    "section": "9.1 Learning to Trust Ourselves",
    "text": "9.1 Learning to Trust Ourselves\nWe see the world through our own lens, which is why knowing ourselves is so very important. What parts of your past experiences in education and life do you bring with you to the classroom? What experiences trigger reactions in you, because they remind you of past experiences or violate your values? Where do you find you are at your best as a facilitator or student? What is important to you? What bothers you?\nIf you can articulate these things clearly—if you know yourself as we discussed earlier in this course—then you will have more confidence and trust yourself as you teach, when creating learning experiences or when encountering difficult situations.\nWhen we honestly know ourselves and we combine a sense of humble awareness with a sincere desire to work with others to make a positive impact, we have more confidence, self-efficacy and an increased willingness to engage – even in difficult situations. In the Bible we read that God is working through all things for our good (Romans 8:28). Consider how this belief might influence your thinking, allowing you to find peace and humble confidence even in difficult situations.\nHow does one get to know oneself? Times of solitude spent reading, creating, writing, reflecting, walking in nature, relationships with others, new experiences, and travel are all activities that allow us to get to know ourselves, depending on our frame of mind. If we read material that helps us ask some of the questions mentioned above through exploring the life of another person (fictional or real) or if we take part in experiences that help us discover what we are good at or what matters to us, these will lead to increased self-knowledge.\nEngaging with literature, music, and art are also ways for us to know ourselves more deeply—and know what it is to be human. Writer Flannery O’Connor illustrates the power of narrative saying:\n\nThere is something in us, as storytellers and as listeners to stories, that demands the redemptive act, which demands that what falls at least be offered the chance to be restored (O’Connor, 1969, p. 48). Why does this matter for the adult educator? It matters because education is about transformation of people—not just their intellectual growth but themselves. Transformation requires knowing oneself first.\n\nAs educators, we know that education can be a transformative experience, not just of students, but also for the organization as and communities in which they serve and lead. And that potential for transformation can give us, as facilitators, leaders, and teachers, much cause for hope.\nChristian leaders and teachers are indeed people of hope and optimism—and the Christian message is one of hope. One of the blessings of hope, found in Jeremiah 29:11 is “’For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ’plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future” (New International Version, Jeremiah 29:11).\nHope is also considered among the experiences that we can gain throughout our lives, despite the hardships we must endure throughout our lives. As we enter our experiences as facilitators of adult learners, we bring this hope with us – a hope that we can facilitate authentic and meaningful learning for them, that we can nurture rich, meaningful, and authentic learning communities, and that we can continue to contribute something beautiful and hopeful to the world.\n\nWe boast in the hope of the glory of God. Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance, perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us. (New International Version, Romans 5:2-5)\n\nHope matters within our learning spaces, both in times of joy and in times of difficulty. Czech statements, author, and dissident Václav Havel (1990) wrote this about hope:\n\nHope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going well, or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously headed for early success, but, rather, an ability to work for something because it is good, not just because it stands a chance to succeed. The more unpropitious the situation in which we demonstrate hope, the deeper that hope is. Hope is not the same thing as optimism. It is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out. In short, I think that the deepest and most important form of hope, the only one that can keep us above water and urge us to good works, and the only true source of the breathtaking dimension of the human spirt and its efforts, is something we get, as it were, from “elsewhere.” It is also this hope, above all which gives us the strength to live and continually to try new things, even in conditions that seem as hopeless as ours do, here and now. (pp. 180-181)\n\nOur students may be hopeful as they enter our learning spaces, or they may be struggling. They may be excited about learning what we have to offer, or concerned about a personal challenge they are experiences. They may be well-rested and grateful for their lives, or tired and dismayed. It is within these myriad experiences of humanity that we engage with our students, within the authentic learning communities we are striving to create.\nIn other words, we need to welcome the reality of whatever learners are bringing to the learning environment and look for the possibilities hidden within their experiences—both present and past—the possibilities for redemption and restoration. For example, some learners may have painful memories of school, a sense of inadequacy, or an inflated view of themselves. Some learners may have experienced severe trauma that affects their ability to process information. Some learners may have trouble reading or writing at the level we would hope they could achieve. Whoever our learners are and whatever abilities or disabilities they bring, we need to create the conditions so they can become better human beings and more knowledgeable and skillful because of having spent time with us as their learning guides.\nOur hope and vision must be rooted in the present. If that present is fraught with difficulties and challenges, the self-aware teacher leader embraces that reality and moves forward trusting themselves and, for the Christian, trusting God is working all things for our good. This requires courage, as Wheatley (2017) notes, this trust is rooted in ‘Coeur’ or heart (p. 279).\nCourage with heart is needed to face the challenges of handling challenging situations when we ourselves might not feel equipped. Courage with heart tempered by intellectual humility is needed to transform lives through education. Effective adult educators are people with a vision for good, with confidence that they can influence positive change and help facilitate transformation in their learners because they are continually working on their own self-knowledge and will research the strategies and methods as well as the content that will be most helpful for their learners to be successful.\n\n9.1.1 Activity: Hold Hands with Strangers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 60 minutes\n\n\n\nRead Chapter 6, “Hold Hands. With Strangers.” in Braving the Wilderness: The Quest for True Belonging and the Courage to Stand Alone (Brown, 2017).\n\nReflect: After reading, identify one key idea that resonates with you—perhaps around collective joy, shared humanity, or the courage of being present with strangers. How could you bring this into your teaching practice?\nTake Action: Choose one small action in your personal or professional life this week where you intentionally “hold hands with strangers” as Brown suggests. Here are a few examples you can start with:\n\nAttend a community event where you do nor know anyone and practice being fully present.\nStrike up a short, genuine conversation with someone you typically pass by (e.g., a colleague in another department, a barista, a neighbor).\nIn a professional setting, invite a colleague you do not usually interact with into a discussion or collaboration.\nParticipate in or create a moment of collective experience (e.g., singing at a service, cheering at a game, walking in solidarity).\n\nShare: Share these actions with another student, your professor, or a friend or family member. Share together the challenges you experience in having the courage to connect with strangers. Share the value of having the courage to do so, even when it is challenging.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.1.2 Activity: Intrigue - How to Create Interest and Connect with Anyone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 45 minutes\n\n\n\nWe will learn to trust ourselves more and build our confidence if we are able to convince even ourselves of our own self-efficacy! Watch “Intrigue - How to Create Interest and Connect with Anyone” (TEDx Talks, 2014) by Sam Horn.\n\n\n\nThe process described in this video teaches the power of three ‘did you know’ questions followed by three attributes or solutions to connect with others and help them understand what is important to you and how you can help them.\nWe can use this strategy in our teaching, inviting our students to engage deeply with the ideas and content we are trying to teach. Practice this by asking yourself:\n\nWhat is my big idea? What do I care deeply that my students learn?\nWhat are three questions or three statistics I can use to help explain the significance of what we are learning?\n\nFollow Sam Horn’s suggested process to create your own intriguing pitch for something you want to teach.

    "text": "9.2 Teaching/Facilitating with Intellectual Humility\nIntellectual humility is the awareness that one’s knowledge is limited and the willingness to revise perspectives considering new evidence or experiences. For educators of adult learners, intellectual humility is not simply a personal trait—it is a leadership stance that shapes how learning communities function. When teachers acknowledge their own limits and invite learners’ insights, they model openness and foster more authentic engagement.\nThe Foundation for Critical Thinking (2014) defines intellectual humility in this way:\n\nHaving a consciousness of the limits of one’s knowledge, including a sensitivity to circumstances in which one’s native egocentrism is likely to function self-deceptively; sensitivity to bias, prejudice, and limitations of one’s viewpoint. Intellectual humility depends on recognizing that one should not claim more than one actually knows. It does not imply spinelessness or submissiveness. It implies the lack of intellectual pretentiousness, boastfulness, or conceit, combined with insight into the logical foundations, or lack of such foundations, of one’s beliefs. (Foundation for Critical Thinking, 2014)\n\n\nWhat is Intellectual Humility?\nAs humans, we tend to believe that we are correct about what we know and believe.\nWhat It Is: Psychologists describe intellectual humility as recognizing the boundaries of your own knowledge and being open to learning from others (Porter & Schumann, 2018). Intellectual humility also means we are open to learning more, to changing our beliefs as we learn more.\nIntellectual humility is different from self-doubt; rather, it combines confidence with curiosity. “People who lack self-confidence might doubt their beliefs not because they are intellectually humble but rather because they evaluate their knowledge or intellectual ability unfavorably” (Leary et al., 2017, p. 794). Instead, those who are intellectually humble demonstrate confidence in their intellectual abilities—but also understand that they do not know everything, and they may need more information, experience, or expertise to learn further.\n\nIntellectual humility is defined as recognizing that a particular personal belief may be fallible, accompanied by an appropriate attentiveness to limitations in the evidentiary basis of that belief and to one’s own limitations in obtaining and evaluating relevant information (Leary et al., 2017, p. 793).\n\nIn other words, intellectual humility is not simply being open to learning, but also seeking out that learning so we can become more certain of our beliefs and knowledge.\nWhat it means for us: As teachers and learners, we can enter learning spaces and experiences with “a willingness to recognize the limits of one’s knowledge and appreciate others’ intellectual strengths” (Porter & Schumann, 2018, p. 140).\nIntellectual humility allows us to enter our teaching and learning experience with the understanding that we have something to give and something to learn. With intellectual humility, we acknowledge that we always have something more to learn.\n\nSome people are generally inclined to view their opinions, beliefs, and positions as subject to further consideration – that is intellectually humble. Yet, even those individuals are likely to have certain views that they are unwilling, or at least unlikely, to reconsider even when confronted with evidence that they could be wrong (Hoyle et al., 2016, p. 165).\n\nAs Hoyle et al. (2016) note here, most of have some areas of our lives in which we are likely to be unmoved, even when presented with evidence that suggests our ideas or knowledge is not valid.\nWhy It Matters for Adult Learners: Adults arrive in classrooms with diverse professional, cultural, and personal experiences. When educators practice intellectual humility, they validate learners as co-contributors to knowledge. Intellectual humility promotes empathy, reduces polarization, and strengthens dialogue across differences. These qualities directly support the creation of inclusive and authentic learning communities.\nHumans have a natural inclination to want to be considered knowledgeable. And, as teachers, facilitators, and leaders, that natural inclination can be even stronger. We might believe we should have the answers to questions that are asked, so that we should know more about a topic than we actually know.\n\nPeople with high intellectual humility might feel less motivated to defend their correctness and intellectual superiority because they are more comfortable acknowledging their intellectual fallibility. We therefore predict that intellectual humility will be associated with openness to learning about opposing perspectives, even during disagreements about highly charged topics (Porter & Schumann, 2018, p. 140).\n\nFunds of Knowledge: As discussed previously, adult learners bring a vast variety of life experience, professional expertise, cultural understanding, social support, and prior educational knowledge into their learning experiences. They also bring with them what Moll et al. (1992) defines as funds of knowledge. “We use the term ‘funds of knowledge’ to refer to these historically accumulate and culturally developed bodies of knowledge and skills essential for household or individual functioning and well-being” (Moll et al., 1992, p. 133).\nIntellectual Humility in Practice: As adult educators, we have the opportunity to facilitate learning from a place of intellectual humility, acknowledging the funds of knowledge our students bring with them into their learning. When we incorporate a servant leadership perspective with intellectual humility, we will seek to engage people’s heads, hearts and hopes and empower learners to turn their newfound knowledge and skills into action.\nWe encourage you to consider how you can infuse your role as teacher, facilitator, or leaders with a focus on the common good, seeking ways to engage confidently in contemporary cultural tensions. With students who are Christian, this perspective of the common good finds its roots and expression in a relationship with Jesus Christ. For students who are not of the Christian faith, strive to espouse this in word and example in a way that is respectful of their heritage and traditions while at the same time giving them an understanding of the Christian worldview. Take the time to listen to those you teach, learning from them what is important to them and seeking to understand their beliefs to build bridges of understanding through respect.\nDr. Adrienne Castellon, a former faculty member at Trinity Western University, shares these thoughts on how her core values influence her teaching:\n\nRealizing that our core values, personality traits, and characteristics impact how we learn and teach, take the time to discern your essential values. For example, I have identified the following six essential values to incorporate into my life and teaching: honesty, integrity, persistence, desire to learn, compassion/empathy and community. Because I value compassion/empathy and community, I put the learner first and design my curricula and methodologies to suit the learners in my class. Because I value persistence and the desire to learn, I don’t give up on students and I try to find ways to help them learn through different methods and alternate ways that they can demonstrate their learning.\n\nThese values direct my entire teaching methodology; I espouse the goals of differentiated instruction (basically changing instructional methods to adapt to different learners) and aim to create a space for learning that empowers all students to succeed. For more information, see “Differentiated Instruction | Definition, Strategies & Examples” (Study.com, n.d.) as a supplementary resource.\nDifferentiated Instruction: One way to demonstrate intellectual humility, is to acknowledge that we all learn differently. Differentiated instruction can become a seamless part of your instructional planning and practice. Differentiated instruction is a teaching approach in which you tailor your teaching and learning activities to meet the diverse needs of learners in your classroom or training session.\nYou can practice differentiated instruction by intentionally creating opportunities to learn about students’ strengths, needs, interests, preferences, and ways of learning. The online tool “What’s Your Learning Style?” is an example of a self-assessment tool to help identify a learner’s learning style. To this end you can use meaningful strategies and ongoing assessment and adjustment. You can differentiate the content, process, or product components of the learning experience by using a range of strategies and methods, e.g., anchor activities, tiered lessons, small-group instruction, and varied tasks. Visit Differentiated Instruction (LINCS, n.d.) to learn more.\nPlease take the time to explore the resources linked in the notes and other resources in your Brookfield and Preskill (2016) and Silberman and Biech (2015) texts. The approach taken throughout this course is an intellectually humble one. In chapters five and six, Brookfield and Preskill (2016) particularly address the power dynamic in the classroom, awareness of which may foster a more intellectually humble approach. You are encouraged to use your texts as primary resources for more detailed information about specific strategies and approaches to contributing as an adult educator while remaining intellectually humble.\n\n\n9.2.1 Activity: Cognitive and Interpersonal Features of Intellectual Humility\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 60 minutes\n\n\n\nRead “Cognitive and Interpersonal Features of Intellectual Humility” (Leary et al., 2017).\nAs you read this article, self-evaluate your level of openness, curiosity, tolerance of ambiguity and dogmatism.\nIn your reflective journal, consider:\n\nWhat two or three actions can you incorporate into your practice as an adult educator and leader to nurture your own intellectual humility and foster it in your students?\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Activity: Openness to Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 45 minutes\n\n\n\nWatch Farah Nasser presenting on “The Power of Intellectual Humility” (TEDx Talks, 2019).\n\n\n\nConsider the ways in which you might make assumptions about those you interact with—not just about who they are, but also about what they believe.\nAs you reflect on this talk, consider the following:\n\nWhat can you learn from Nasser’s (2019) experience with her coworker?\nHow can you remain open to hearing others’ beliefs? How can you feel comfortable sharing your own?\nWhat can you learn from your colleagues, students, and teachers?\nHow can you expand your community, so you encounter others who have different beliefs from you?\nWhat small questions can you ask to make more connections?\nHow and where can you practice listening?\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.3 Activity: Reflection and Discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 75 minutes\n\n\n\nAs we finish this unit, let’s pause and turn inward. Self-awareness and intellectual humility are not only ideas to think about—they are also practices we can feel and live in our bodies.\nPersonal reflection (choose one practice): Take 10–15 minutes to engage in a quiet activity that helps you center yourself.\nYou might:\n\nTake a short walk outdoors, noticing what comes into awareness with each step.\nBrew a cup of tea or coffee, paying attention to the ritual of preparing and savoring it.\nSit quietly and take three deep breaths, noticing the rhythm of your body.\nSketch or doodle freely for a few minutes, letting your hand move without judgment.\n\nAs you engage in this reflective experience, hold in mind these questions:\n\nWho am I becoming as an educator?\nHow can I hold both confidence and humility in this role?\n\nShare Your Insight: After your reflection, in the learning community share:\n\nOne insight you discovered about yourself through the practice\nHow that insight might influence the contribution you want to make as an adult educator\nA way you plan to nurture intellectual humility in your teaching or learning environment\n\nEngage with Others: Read the reflections of your peers. Notice what resonates with you or expands your perspective. Respond to at least two peers, practicing humility by naming what you learned from their insights or how their experience challenged or enriched your own.\nNote: This activity serves as the discussion prompt for this unit. Share your response and connect with others in the Learning Community to deepen your understanding.",

    "text": "Summary\nIn this unit, we have explored the inward dimensions of becoming authentic and effective adult educators. Teaching begins with self-awareness. By learning to know ourselves—our values, strengths, and limitations—we create the foundation to trust our own presence in the classroom. As Palmer (2017) explains, “we teach who we are” (p. 2), reminding us that authenticity and inner clarity are essential to building trust with learners. This self-trust enables us to engage learners with confidence and openness, even in moments of uncertainty.\nAlongside self-knowledge, we also considered the practice of intellectual humility. For adult educators, intellectual humility is not about diminishing our own expertise, but about modeling curiosity, openness to new perspectives, and a willingness to learn from students as well as colleagues. This practice allows us to foster authentic relationships, strengthen trust in the learning community, and invite shared exploration rooted in respect and mutual growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking Your Learning\n\n\n\nBefore you move on to the next unit, you may want to check to make sure that you are able to:\n\nexplain why self-knowledge is an important part of being an effective adult educator and leads to increased self-confidence and humility.\ndescribe the contribution you want to make as an adult educator.\ndefine intellectual humility in your own words.\ndescribe strategies to foster intellectual humility in yourself and in your learning environment.",

    "section": "10.1 Building Your Platform of Beliefs",
    "text": "10.1 Building Your Platform of Beliefs\nYour platform of beliefs is a foundation for how you approach teaching and facilitation as an adult educator. It brings together your values, your understanding of adult learning theories, and your commitment to creating authentic learning communities.\nA strong platform of beliefs does more than list abstract ideas—it reflects who you are, how you show up with learners, and how you engage in relationships that support deep, authentic learning.\nAs you create your platform, you will want to:\n\nAnchor your beliefs in authenticity. Consider how being transparent, present, and genuine in your facilitation shapes learning experiences.\nEngage with adult learning theory. Kolb’s (1984) Experiential Learning Theory, Mezirow’s (1997) Transformative Learning Theory, and Knowles’ (1980) Andragogy offer useful perspectives on how adults learn. Your beliefs may align with some, challenge others, or integrate elements of each.\nDraw on culturally responsive teaching. Reflect on how your beliefs support inclusivity, respect, and responsiveness to the lived experiences of diverse learners.\nInclude Indigenous ways of knowing. Ask how your beliefs acknowledge interconnectedness, respect for community, and the relational nature of knowledge.\n\nYour platform of beliefs should not feel static, it will grow as you encounter new contexts and continue reflecting on your practice. The work you already completed in earlier course activities—drafting your initial beliefs, exploring relationships and values, and engaging with adult learning theories—will guide you in shaping your platform for the final assignment in this course.\n\n10.1.1 Activity: Synthesizing Your Platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 90 minutes\n\n\n\nAs you prepare for the final course assignment, this activity will help you consolidate your learning from earlier reflections, theories, and course content into a clear foundation for your platform of beliefs. Thinking about your beliefs can be challenging, in a task-driven world that often prioritizes action over reflection. However, as Palmer (2017) urges us to do, taking time for your own personal reflections now can allow you to show up in your classroom later (whether online or on-site) with more presence and authenticity. You are encouraged to create space for reflection. Make yourself a warm drink and curl up on the couch, go for a walk in the forest or a nearby park, or take your reflective journal with you to a coffee shop. Take some time to think deeply about who you want to be as a facilitator or teacher.\n\nReview Your Work So Far\n\nReview your reflective journal, including your draft beliefs from earlier learning activities.\nRevisit your notes on Kolb, Mezirow, and Knowles.\nReflect on what you have learned about authenticity, culturally responsive teaching, and Indigenous ways of knowing in this course, and in your life.\n\nIdentify Patterns and Tensions\n\nWhich ideas or values keep showing up across your reflections?\nWhere do your beliefs align with theory, and where do you find yourself pushing back or adding nuance?\nHow have relationships with learners, communities, and knowledge traditions shaped your thinking?\nWhat kind of learning community do you want to create?\n\nDraft a Platform-in-Progress\n\nWrite four to five (4–5) belief statements that feel central to your identity as a facilitator of adult learning.\nUnder each belief, briefly note:\n\nHow it reflects your authenticity\nWhich theory or framework it connects to (or resists)\nHow it speaks to culturally responsive or Indigenous approaches\n\n\nCreative Expression\n\nRepresent your beliefs in a format that speaks to you: a concept map, a short video reflection, or even a set of visual images with annotations.\nThis creative piece is for you—so you can help clarify your thinking. You may choose to include it in your final assignment, instead of a paper.\n\nShort Journal Reflection (½ – 1 page)\n\nIn your reflective journal, respond to the following prompts:\n\nWhich beliefs feel most solid to you right now?\nWhere do you still feel uncertain or open to growth?\nHow might your Platform guide your facilitation of authentic learning communities?",

    "section": "10.2 Creating Learning Outcomes",
    "text": "10.2 Creating Learning Outcomes\nBefore determining what we will teach, we need to consider what students will learn. As teachers and facilitators, we may be asked to teach a course that already has learning outcomes – or conduct a training for an employer that knows exactly what they want their employees to know at the end of the training. In that case, we can review those learning outcomes, and then design learning experiences that ensure students learn what we want them to learn. However, sometimes we are the ones tasked with developing the learning outcomes—that is, we are responsible for determining what want participants in our course or training to learn. Thus, will review here how to write an effective learning outcome.\nLearning outcomes, simply put, encapsulate in a short sentence, what we want students/employees to learn. To consider this, we can begin by asking ourselves this question:\n\nWhat essential learning must take place for students to learn the knowledge/skills/values to prepare for higher-level coursework or engage in the profession?\n\nLearning outcomes allow us to ensure that both students and instructors know why they are engaging in the learning process. Our goal, after all, as teachers and facilitators, is not just to teach or facilitate – but for students/employees to learn. As Barr and Tagg (1995) put it, “Our mission is not instruction but rather producing learning with eery student by whatever means works best” (p. 13). When we create learning outcomes, we are thinking then, of what we want students/employees to learn. Only with a strong learning outcome can we move forward to design the learning experience so students/employees are able to achieve that learning outcome.\nThere is a simple formula we can use to create a measurable learning outcome:\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: Formula for a Student Learning Outcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Credited by R. Kang and TWU. Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\nYou may have noticed that, in each of your courses at Trinity, there are course learning outcomes (what you will learn in the course) and unit learning outcomes (what you will learn in the unit). These learning outcomes generally follow the formula in Figure 1.\nFor example, the learning outcomes in this course are:\nStudents will be able to:\n\nInterpret the influence of teacher authenticity on student learning.\nDevelop a personal philosophy of your role as facilitator in creating authentic learning communities.\nCreate a platform of beliefs regarding adult learning for a specific organization.\nEvaluate strategies for developing learning connections with and between students.\nApply strategies for creating authentic learning communities that include Indigenous ways of knowing.\nAnalyze the effectiveness of training and employee development.\n\nThese learning outcomes follow the formula provided in Figure 1:\n\nEach of these learning outcomes begin with “Students will be able to….”\nEach outcome has an action verb that clearly states the skill-level a student should have (interpret, develop, create, etc.).\nEach outcome includes a short and simple description of what students should learn in this course.\n\n\n10.2.1 Activity: Designing a Learning Outcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 90 minutes\n\n\n\nIn your final assignment in this course, you will design a learning experience for adult learners. To prepare for that assignment, you will begin by considering what you want the adult learners to learn.\n\nReview the instructions for Assignment 3: Authentic Learning Experience Design.\nIn your reflective journal, take some time to consider the following questions:\n\nWhat do I want these adult learners to learn?\nDo these learning outcomes align with my platform of beliefs? How?\nDo these learning outcomes match what the organization wants their students/employees to learn?\n\nDesign two to three (2-3) learning outcomes for the learning experience you want to create.\nCheck each of the learning outcomes to ensure they are specific and measurable. In other words, will you be able to measure whether the learners have achieved the learning outcomes?\n\nTo learn about Bloom’s Taxonomy of Learning, watch Bloom’s Taxonomy - Explained in 3 Minutes (Helpful Professor Explains, 2024).\n\n\n\nYou can also read Bloom’s Taxonomy for Learning: The Cognitive Domain (Food for Thought, n.d.) to learn more.\nIf you need help in designing learning outcomes, review the following resources:\n\nUniversity of British Columbia.

    "text": "10.4 Administrative and Supervisory Aspects of an Adult Educator\nTeaching a group of learners also involves non-instructional duties. Sometimes there is a tension between our philosophical beliefs about authentic teaching and learning and the organizational realities we face. In addition to creating authentic learning experiences, your teaching responsibilities will often require you to track and report on learners’ progress, submit grades or summary reports to the organization, order textbooks or supplies, work with an assistant such as a learning coach or teacher assistant, book classrooms…The possibilities are many!\nBeyond your own classroom, you may be asked to contribute to committees and other meetings about the operational aspects of the education facility. Few educators work alone. We are almost all part of an organizational context which has implications for our work. Organizations have expectations and the relationship between the adult educator and the organization is important to consider. Sometimes what is asked of us organizationally will conflict with our philosophy of how to carry out assessment or what it means to advise and guide students on their educational journey. The time invested in meetings is important for the organization to flourish and enable the teaching and learning to happen at all yet, this time commitment can detract from planning authentic learning experiences and having the time to give extensive formative feedback. Every organization is driven by a set of values which will apply to the educational environment. If there is an outside funder for example, then reports to demonstrate progress and results will need great care and handling since this is what makes programs possible at all. Educators must not only promote what they consider the best way to do things but also consider what others expect and need from the program.\nDuring this course you have focused on how to develop authentic learning communities. Authentic learning communities take place within organizational contexts. Priorities between these two—developing authentic learning communities and organizational realities—are not always aligned. However, it behooves the critical thinker to figure out how to align them as much as possible. This is a challenge worth embracing to be personally and professionally fulfilled.\n\nNo matter how hopeful our dialogue has been, no matter how many of our colleagues have embraced a new vision, no matter how many practical possibilities we have explored, someone will say, ‘These are wonderful ideas, but every last one of them will be defeated by conditions in my school’ (Palmer, 2017, p. 170).\n\nPalmer (2017) suggests that change begins when we, as individual teachers and facilitators, “make an inward decision to live ‘divided no more,’ finding a center for their lives outside of institutions” and “begin to discover one another and form communities of congruence that offer mutual support and opportunities to develop a shared vision” (pp. 172-173).\n\n10.4.1 Activity: Closing Song\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 30 minutes\n\n\n\nAs a closing activity for this course, take some time to immerse yourself in some poetry, quotes, and music that reminds us of the sacred nature of the teaching and learning process. Let’s pause to reflect on the opportunity we have to create and nurture authentic learning communities. As a teacher or facilitator, you are involved in transforming others’ lives.\nChoose one of the following pieces to reflect on:\nMusic\n\nWhat would you think if I sang out of tune? Would you stand up and walk out on me? Lend me your ears and I’ll sing you a song, And I’ll try not to sing out of key. I get by with a little help from my friends.\n— With a Little Help from My Friends (The Beatles, 2018)\n\nQuote\n\nGood teaching cannot be reduced to technique; good teaching comes from the identity and integrity of the teacher.\n— The Courage to Teach (Palmer, 2017)\n\nScripture\n\nJust as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ. For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many.\n— 1 Corinthians 12:12–27 (NIV)\n\nMusic\n\nFresh and green we will remain Bearing fruit to a ripe old age Happy to tell about Your name A blessed endeavour The righteous flourish like the palm And grow like cedars of Lebanon Planted in the courts of God Forever and ever\nThe senseless person doesn’t know The wonders of Your glory And yet their hoppers overflow But they don’t understand That folly springs up like the grass And spreads throughout these vast lands But harvesting will come to pass When everything is shown Everything will be exposed Fresh and green…\nIt is so good to sing of You At the first light of the morning And at night Your faithfulness review Before I close my eyes And sometimes in the dimming light I stumble on Your glory That overwhelming sudden fright But not the daunting kind It’s so hard to describe.\n— Fresh and Green by Steve Bell (2015).",

    "text": "Summary\nAs you complete this unit, take a moment to reflect on what you have learned in this course. In this unit, you have explored your personal beliefs as a facilitator, connected these beliefs to adult learning theory, practiced designing meaningful learning outcomes, and considered the practical responsibilities of adult education. By engaging with the reflective activity on community, authenticity, and relational learning, you can see how these pieces come together to shape authentic learning experiences. Carry forward the connections you have made here as you move toward your summative assignment, knowing that your Platform of Beliefs, grounded in values and relationships, will guide your growth as an intentional, reflective, and community-centered educator.\nIn your role as an adult educator, you have the opportunity to change lives and cultivate growth of the mind and spirit. May the work you undertake grow within you a greatness of vision, stir your spirit so that you can see and love the common good more, and create an environment where all whom you serve can thrive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking Your Learning\n\n\n\nBefore you move on to the next unit, you may want to check to make sure that you are able to:\n\nDescribe your ideal adult learning environment.\nDescribe the supervisory and/or administrative aspects for which adult educators are accountable.\nCreate a platform of beliefs regarding adult learning for a specific context/organization.",

Select someone who is also a coach, teacher or facilitator—or select another student. You may also choose to complete this interview with a group. By conducting an appreciative interview, you will explore strategies for creating inclusive, collaborative learning communities.\nPart 1\nRead the article, “Appreciative Interviews (AI)” (Liberating Structures, n.d.). As you read, you will see that these instructions are developed for groups. However, if you are conducting your interview with an individual, you may still find these instructions helpful.\nNext, read “119+ Appreciative Inquiry Interview Questions and Examples” (Moore, 2019).\nFirst, develop a minimum of five questions to guide the interview process. The questions should be developed based on your course learning to date, and should integrate the articles, TED talks, short films, and other resources we have reviewed together. Building on your learning, develop at least five questions that you will ask another learner, to answer the guiding questions of this unit:\n\nWhat strategies invite students to engage in collaborative learning?\nWhat strategies can you use in online learning environments to support connections between students?\n\nPart 2\nThen, contact your friend or colleague and schedule a time to meet, preferably face-to-face, or through zoom, skype, some other form of video conferencing, or by phone.\nPart 3\nAfter you have completed the interview, prepare a 250-word reflection on what you have learned from the interview, identifying at least three strategies you can use to engage students in collaborative learning as well as strategies you can use to support connections between students in online learning environments. Be sure to reference the other learner for her/his original ideas.\nNote: This activity serves as the discussion prompt for this unit.

As you watch the video, consider: How might assumption and perceptions impact your role as an adult educator? How are adult educators servant leaders?\nQuestions to Consider\n\nHow are you going to live out the seven concepts of intentional practice Frett outlines? List each of the concepts and how you could live each one.\nReference the Silberman and Brookfield texts and find one strategy to apply to each of the seven concepts. List each concept of intentional practice and your chosen strategy beside it, include a brief description of the strategy.\nIn a general manner, explain how to use the strategies with intentionality to be a servant leader in the adult learning environment.\n\nNote: This activity serves as the discussion prompt for this unit. Share your response and connect with others in the Learning Community to deepen your understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit 8 Discussion\n\nActivity: Interconnectedness and Relationship Networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 150 minutes\n\n\n\nRead Chapter 6, “Interconnectedness,” in Who Do We Choose to Be: Facing Reality, Claiming Leadership, Restoring Sanity (Wheatley, 2017).\nAs you read this chapter, think about Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s comment: “We exist in a bundle of life. We say, ‘A person is a person through other people.’ It is not ‘I think therefore I am’ [but rather] I am human because I belong. I participate, I share” (as cited in Wheatley, 2017, p. 223).\nBased on the reading, reflect on the following questions:\n\nWho has influenced you to become the person you are? Who do you depend on as ground and support for your life?\nDemonstrate your network of relationships and annotate with the key values or wisdom you have learned from each person.\nBecause of the influence of these individuals on your values, choose two strategies from Brookfield or Silberman and show how they align with these values. (Choose strategies not previously described in your response.)\n\nCreate a concept map to show your networks of relationships using tools such as bubbl.us or popplet.com, or on paper, take a picture and include it in your post. Reflect on how this relates to your teaching/facilitating work.\nNote: This activity serves as the discussion prompt for this unit. Share your response and connect with others in the Learning Community to deepen your understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit 9 Discussion\n\nActivity: Reflection and Discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Time: 75 minutes\n\n\n\nAs we finish this unit, let’s pause and turn inward. Self-awareness and intellectual humility are not only ideas to think about — they are also practices we can feel and live in our bodies.\nPersonal Reflection (choose one): Take 10–15 minutes to engage in a quiet activity that helps you center yourself. You might:\n\nTake a short walk outdoors, noticing what comes into awareness with each step.\nBrew a cup of tea or coffee, paying attention to the ritual of preparing and savoring it.\nSit quietly and take three deep breaths, noticing the rhythm of your body.\nSketch or doodle freely for a few minutes, letting your hand move without judgment.\n\nAs you engage in this reflective experience, hold in mind these questions:\n\nWho am I becoming as an educator?\nHow can I hold both confidence and humility in this role?\n\nShare your insight: After your reflection, share the following in the learning community:\n\none insight you discovered about yourself through the practice\nhow that insight might influence the contribution you want to make as an adult educator\na way you plan to nurture intellectual humility in your teaching or learning environment\n\nEngage with others: Read the reflections of your peers. Notice what resonates with you or expands your perspective. Respond to at least two (2) peers, practicing humility by naming what you learned from their insights or how their experience challenged or enriched your own.\nNote: This activity serves as the discussion prompt for this unit. Share your response and connect with others in the Learning Community to deepen your understanding.",
