# The Heart of Teaching, Coaching, or Facilitation

## Overview {.unnumbered}

As humans, we long for authenticity in our relationships. We want to feel "at home" in the organizations that we are part of—our families, schools, communities, places of worship. We seek connection. We search for a place where we are known.

This sense of being "at home" is essential to our experience as learners. Deep, authentic learning happens in spaces where we feel connected with others—places and spaces where we are known. Palmer [-@palmerCourageTeachExploring2017] refers to this as the "spiritual quest for connectedness" (p. 5).

In this course, we will explore together the theoretical foundations of learning communities, evaluating key elements essential to creating authentic learning communities, where learners are known and learning is authentic. Our hope is that, in this course, together we will expand our expertise in creating authentic learning communities, where all learners know they belong—and where all members of the learning community engage in deep learning.

In Unit 1, we will engage with the writings of Parker Palmer, a teacher and writer who has written several important works regarding the essential role of authenticity in teaching and learning.

In addition to reading, throughout this course, we will also listen to music and view several short films that will allow us to more deeply engage with the concepts of belonging and authenticity within the teaching/learning experience.

Unit 1 focuses on two guiding questions:

- What does it mean to teach, coach, or facilitate from a place of authenticity?
- What is the facilitator’s role in creating spaces for authentic learning?

### Topics {.unnumbered}

This unit is divided into the following topics:

## Prelude

For this course, you will keep a reflective journal which can be useful as a learning tool. Writing can be a powerful learning experience, as we engage in reflection and critical analysis of the new concepts we discover. Through regular writing, we are challenged to think critically, organize, and integrate these new concepts with our prior understanding, as you prepare for your future teaching, coaching, or facilitation. Whether it’s paper-based or electronic, start your reflective journaling today as you continue your learning journey. To learn more about reflective journaling, see ["Reflective Journals and Learning Logs"](https://www.niu.edu/citl/resources/guides/instructional-guide/reflective-journals-and-learning-logs.shtml){target="_blank"} [@northernillinoisuniversityReflectiveJournalsLearning2012].

If you would like to set up an online space for reflective journaling, platforms such as OneNote, Google Site, and WordPress are good options to consider. If you choose WordPress, you can create a site using your TWU student account.

### Activity: Starting with Purpose

::: {.learning-activity time="30"}

Before we dive into the course topics, let’s take a moment to reflect on your purpose and set your learning goals. As your first entry for this course, respond to the following questions in your reflective journal:

- What do you hope to learn or accomplish in this course?
- Why is this learning important to you? How does it connect to your experience or future aspirations?
- What challenges do you anticipate, and how might you address them?

## Authenticity in Teaching and Learning

:::note
*Note:* Teaching and learning occur in many contexts, not just in traditional classrooms. In this course the term "teaching" encompasses much more than the role of a teacher. It can include various forms of coaching, facilitation, and leadership. Consider your own experiences: whether coaching your client, facilitating a discussion, or leading a team, each of these roles embodies the essence of teaching.
:::

Teaching and learning are deeply personal experiences. Learning is, by definition, a transformative experience; we change as a result of learning. Teaching is also a transformative experience; we change as a result of teaching.

Authentic Learners and Authentic Teachers Model
:::

::: text-source
*Source:* From *Authentic learners and authentic teachers model* [@penfoldnavarroAuthenticLearnersAuthentic2018]
:::

In his book, *The Courage to Teach: Exploring the Inner Landscape of a Teacher’s Life*, Parker Palmer [-@palmerCourageTeachExploring2017] argues that the "inner landscape of teaching" is an essential foundation out of which authentic learning experiences emerge.

> Teachers possess the power to create conditions that can help students learn a great deal – or keep them from learning much at all. Teaching is the intentional act of creating those conditions, and good teaching requires that we understand the inner sources of both the intent and the act. [@palmerCourageTeachExploring2017, p. 7]

### Activity: The Heart of a Teacher

::: {.learning-activity time="60"}

As we explore the importance of the "inner life of the teacher" as a foundation for authentic learning, read Chapter 1, "The Heart of a Teacher: Identity and Integrity in Teaching," in *The Courage to Teach: Exploring the Inner Landscape of a Teacher's Life* [@palmerCourageTeachExploring2017].

As you read, consider the following questions:

- When have you felt "at home" within a learning community?
- What was it about that learning experience that made you feel at "home"?
- What does it mean for you to be authentic as a teacher, facilitator, or leader?
- How do we create authentic learning experiences and spaces?

:::

## Identity and Integrity in Teaching, Facilitating, or Leadership

Identity and integrity are foundational to good teaching, facilitation, and leadership. This means we must endeavour to know ourselves to create learning spaces that foster integrity in our students, clients, or team members, allowing them to authentically engage with each other, with us, and with the discipline we are studying.

To have integrity, we must know our own values and strengths, our own beliefs about teaching and learning, and our own perspective on the work we are doing. "If the work we do lacks integrity for us, then we, the work, and the people we do it with will suffer" [@palmerCourageTeachExploring2017, p. 16].

### Activity: Value Sort

::: {.learning-activity time="45"}

As a teacher, coach, or facilitator, it is important to identify and reflect on your own values. Complete [this value sort activity](https://www.thegoodproject.org/value-sort){target="_blank"} [@thegoodprojectValueSortActivity] to find out what is truly important to you and others.

After the activity, take some time to answer the questions below in your reflective learning journal:

- Consider why you are taking this course. Why do you want to teach, coach, or facilitate learning?
- What are your beliefs about learning? What are your values about learning?
- What are your strengths? Where do you need help?

## Creating Authentic Learning Spaces

> "For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known" (English Standard Version Bible, 1 Corinthians 13:12)

As we begin thinking about creating authentic learning spaces, consider a time when you have felt "at home" within a learning community, whether in formal education, your faith community, or your employment. What elements made that learning space feel like "home?"

In the song, "[Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoRkntoHkIE){target="_blank"}" [@phillipphillipsPhillipPhillipsHome2012], Phillip Phillips sings about the universal need we share as humans to "belong." Take a moment now to listen to this song, considering what the lyrics say about what it means to belong.

> Just know you’re not alone, ’Cause I’m going to make this place your home. – Phillip Phillips

For students to authentically learn, we must create learning spaces that are safe, where students know and feel that they belong. Palmer [-@palmerCourageTeachExploring2017] refers to this need for belonging as the "spiritual quest for connectedness" (p.5).

If a sense of belonging provides a foundation for learning, then in our role as teachers, facilitators, or coaches, we must endeavour to create spaces where students know and feel that they belong.

> Good teachers possess a capacity for connectedness. They are able to weave a complex web of connections among themselves, their subjects, and their students so that students can learn to weave a world for themselves [@palmerCourageTeachExploring2017, p. 11].
> Good teachers possess a capacity for connectedness. They are able to weave a complex web of connections among themselves, their subjects, and their students so that students can learn to weave a world for themselves [@palmerCourageTeachExploring2017, p. 11].

But how is this done?

In "To Know as We Are Known," Palmer [-@palmerKnowWeAre1993] suggests that learning spaces must include openness, boundaries, and an air of hospitality. These learning spaces, according to Palmer [-@palmerKnowWeAre1993] can be spaces "both to be and to become" (p. 71).

### Activity: Strategies for Creating an Authentic Learning Environment

::: {.learning-activity time="60"}

Rank the following strategies according to your comfort level. For each strategy, list one practical action you can take in an online learning environment (as facilitator or learner) to create an authentic learning space that is hospitable and open.

> "To study with a teacher who not only speaks but listens, who not only gives answers but asks questions and welcomes our insights, who provides information and theories that do not close doors but open new ones, who encourages students to help each other learn – to study with such a teacher is to know the power of a learning space" [@palmerCourageTeachExploring2017, pp. 70-71].

1. Speaking
2. Listening
3. Giving answers
4. Asking questions
5. Providing information/theories that open doors
6. Encouraging students to help each other learn

Next, read the discussion of authentic learning environments in Herrington and Oliver [-@herringtonInstructionalDesignFramework2000] and Oliver et al. [-@oliverRepresentingAuthenticLearning2007] and consider how the elements they discuss align with or differ from Palmer’s [-@palmerCourageTeachExploring2017] description of learning communities.

- Herrington, J. and Oliver, R. [-@herringtonInstructionalDesignFramework2000]. [An instructional design framework for authentic learning environments](https://twu.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.30220266&site=eds-live&scope=site){target="_blank"}. *Educational Technology Research and Development, 48*(3), 23–48.
- Oliver R., Herrington, A. Herrington, J. & Reeves, T.C. [-@oliverRepresentingAuthenticLearning2007].

**Questions to Consider**

- What are the important values that will guide my teaching/facilitation?
- What elements matter most to me in a learning community?
- What elements matter most to learners?
- What can I do to create hospitable learning spaces?

### Activity: Reflective Discussion

::: {.learning-activity time="75"}

After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to write in your Reflective Journal. This activity will prepare you for future activities in this course, including your final assignment. Use the following to guide your reflection and writing:

**Part 1:** Incorporating the readings in Unit 1, write a 150-250-word discussion post that addresses the following:

- List and describe three values you hold related to teaching and learning.
- Write a personal statement about your identity as a teacher, coach, or facilitator.

**Part 2:** For the second part of your discussion, write a 150-250 response to the following:

- Consider the key elements of authentic learning spaces, outlined by Palmer [-@palmerCourageTeachExploring2017] in Chapter 3. Select two of these elements that you consider to be important.
- Introduce the element and discuss some practical steps you could take to create an authentic learning space.

Be sure to cite Palmer [-@palmerCourageTeachExploring2017] and other authors in your journal to demonstrate ways in which your thinking aligns with, contrasts with, or builds on the writing of the authors.

*Note:* This activity serves as the discussion prompt for this unit. Share your response and connect with others in the Discussion Forum in Moodle to deepen your understanding.

## Summary {.unnumbered}

In this first unit, you have had the opportunity to think and learn about you identify and beliefs about your role as a teacher, coach, or facilitator, and consider key elements of authentic learning communities. The hunger for authentic human relationships and authentic learning can and should compel us to consider our own identity and integrity, both as teachers and learners. In our next unit, we will explore ideas related to vulnerability in leadership, and learning to be "at home" with ourselves so we can, in turn, lead and teach others.

::: check

Before you move on to the next unit, you may want to check to make sure that you are able to:

- describe your own personal identity as a teacher, coach, or facilitator.
- identify your personal beliefs about your role as a teacher, coach, or facilitator.
