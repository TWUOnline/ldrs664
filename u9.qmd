# Confidence and Humility

## Overview {.unnumbered}

In this unit, you will explore the role of trust, confidence and intellectual humility in the practice and dispositions of the adult educator who is trying to establish an authentic learning community. You will consider your values as an individual as well as an educator and help you to define your role and purpose as an adult educator.

Unit 9 focuses on three guiding questions:

- What fosters self-knowledge?
- What is worth doing as an adult educator?
- What strategies foster intellectual humility in ourselves and in our learning environment?


### Topics {.unnumbered}

This unit is divided into the following topics:

1. Learning to Trust Ourselves
2. Teaching/Facilitating with Intellectual Humility

## Learning to Trust Ourselves

We see the world through our own lens, which is why knowing ourselves is so very important. What parts of your past experiences in education and life do you bring with you to the classroom? What experiences trigger reactions in you, because they remind you of past experiences or violate your values? Where do you find you are at your best as a facilitator or student? What is important to you? What bothers you?

If you can articulate these things clearly—if you know yourself as we discussed earlier in this course—then you will have more confidence and trust yourself as you teach, when creating learning experiences or when encountering difficult situations.

When we honestly know ourselves and we combine a sense of humble awareness with a sincere desire to work with others to make a positive impact, we have more confidence, self-efficacy and an increased willingness to engage – even in difficult situations. In the Bible we read that God is working through all things for our good (Romans 8:28). Consider how this belief might influence your thinking, allowing you to find peace and humble confidence even in difficult situations.

How does one get to know oneself? Times of solitude spent reading, creating, writing, reflecting, walking in nature, relationships with others, new experiences, and travel are all activities that allow us to get to know ourselves, depending on our frame of mind. If we read material that helps us ask some of the questions mentioned above through exploring the life of another person (fictional or real) or if we take part in experiences that help us discover what we are good at or what matters to us, these will lead to increased self-knowledge.

Engaging with literature, music, and art are also ways for us to know ourselves more deeply—and know what it is to be human. Writer Flannery O’Connor illustrates the power of narrative saying:

> There is something in us, as storytellers and as listeners to stories, that demands the redemptive act, which demands that what falls at least be offered the chance to be restored. (O’Connor, 1970, p. 48.). Why does this matter for the adult educator? It matters because education is about transformation of people—not just their intellectual growth but themselves. Transformation requires knowing oneself first.

As educators, we know that education can be a transformative experience, not just of students, but also for the organization as and communities in which they serve and lead. And that potential for transformation can give us, as facilitators, leaders, and teachers, much cause for hope.

Christian leaders and teachers are indeed people of hope and optimism—and the Christian message is one of hope. One of the blessings of hope, found in Jeremiah 29:11 is "’For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future" (New International Version, Jeremiah 29:11).

Hope is also considered among the experiences that we can gain throughout our lives, despite the hardships we must endure throughout our lives. As we enter our experiences as facilitators of adult learners, we bring this hope with us – a hope that we can facilitate authentic and meaningful learning for them, that we can nurture rich, meaningful, and authentic learning communities, and that we can continue to contribute something beautiful and hopeful to the world.

> We boast in the hope of the glory of God. Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance, perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us. (New International Version, Romans 5:2-5)

Hope matters within our learning spaces, both in times of joy and in times of difficulty. Czech statements, author, and dissident Václav Havel (1990) wrote this about hope:

> Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going well, or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously headed for early success, but, rather, an ability to work for something because it is good, not just because it stands a chance to succeed. The more unpropitious the situation in which we demonstrate hope, the deeper that hope is. Hope is not the same thing as optimism. It is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out. In short, I think that the deepest and most important form of hope, the only one that can keep us above water and urge us to good works, and the only true source of the breathtaking dimension of the human spirt and its efforts, is something we get, as it were, from "elsewhere." It is also this hope, above all which gives us the strength to live and continually to try new things, even in conditions that seem as hopeless as ours do, here and now. (pp. 180-181)

Our students may be hopeful as they enter our learning spaces, or they may be struggling. They may be excited about learning what we have to offer, or concerned about a personal challenge they are experiences. They may be well-rested and grateful for their lives, or tired and dismayed. It is within these myriad experiences of humanity that we engage with our students, within the authentic learning communities we are striving to create.

In other words, we need to welcome the reality of whatever learners are bringing to the learning environment and look for the possibilities hidden within their experiences—both present and past—the possibilities for redemption and restoration. For example, some learners may have painful memories of school, a sense of inadequacy, or an inflated view of themselves. Some learners may have experienced severe trauma that affects their ability to process information. Some learners may have trouble reading or writing at the level we would hope they could achieve. Whoever our learners are and whatever abilities or disabilities they bring, we need to create the conditions so they can become better human beings and more knowledgeable and skillful because of having spent time with us as their learning guides.

Our hope and vision must be rooted in the present. If that present is fraught with difficulties and challenges, the self-aware teacher leader embraces that reality and moves forward trusting themselves and, for the Christian, trusting God is working all things for our good. This requires courage, as Wheatley (2017) notes, this trust is rooted in ‘Coeur’ or heart (p. 279).

Courage with heart is needed to face the challenges of handling challenging situations when we ourselves might not feel equipped. Courage with heart tempered by intellectual humility is needed to transform lives through education. Effective adult educators are people with a vision for good, with confidence that they can influence positive change and help facilitate transformation in their learners because they are continually working on their own self-knowledge and will research the strategies and methods as well as the content that will be most helpful for their learners to be successful.


### Activity: Hold Hands with Strangers

::: {.learning-activity time="60"}

Read Chapter 6, "Hold Hands. With Strangers." in *Braving the Wilderness: The Quest for True Belonging and the Courage to Stand Alone* (Brown, 2017).

1. **Reflect:** After reading, identify one key idea that resonates with you—perhaps around collective joy, shared humanity, or the courage of being present with strangers. How could you bring this into your teaching practice?
2. **Take Action:** Choose one small action in your personal or professional life this week where you intentionally "hold hands with strangers" as Brown suggests. Here are a few examples you can start with:
   - Attend a community event where you do nor know anyone and practice being fully present.
   - Strike up a short, genuine conversation with someone you typically pass by (e.g., a colleague in another department, a barista, a neighbor).
   - In a professional setting, invite a colleague you do not usually interact with into a discussion or collaboration.
   - Participate in or create a moment of collective experience (e.g., singing at a service, cheering at a game, walking in solidarity).
3. **Share:** Share these actions with another student, your professor, or a friend or family member. Share together the challenges you experience in having the courage to connect with strangers. Share the value of having the courage to do so, even when it is challenging.

### Activity: Intrigue - How to Create Interest and Connect with Anyone

::: {.learning-activity time="45"}

We will learn to trust ourselves more and build our confidence if we are able to convince even ourselves of our own self-efficacy! Watch ["Intrigue - How to Create Interest and Connect with Anyone"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xlg8zdSVjgg){target="_blank"} (TEDx Talks, 2014) by Sam Horn.

::: video-container
{{< video https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xlg8zdSVjgg >}}
:::

The process described in this video teaches the power of three ‘did you know’ questions followed by three attributes or solutions to connect with others and help them understand what is important to you and how you can help them.

We can use this strategy in our teaching, inviting our students to engage deeply with the ideas and content we are trying to teach. Practice this by asking yourself:

- What is my big idea? What do I care deeply that my students learn?
- What are three questions or three statistics I can use to help explain the significance of what we are learning?

Follow Sam Horn’s suggested process to create your own intriguing pitch for something you want to teach. Try it out with others until it sounds natural and comes easily to you. Then, try it in a class you plan or hope to teach.

## Teaching/Facilitating with Intellectual Humility

Intellectual humility is the awareness that one’s knowledge is limited and the willingness to revise perspectives considering new evidence or experiences. For educators of adult learners, intellectual humility is not simply a personal trait—it is a leadership stance that shapes how learning communities function. When teachers acknowledge their own limits and invite learners’ insights, they model openness and foster more authentic engagement.

The Foundation for Critical Thinking (2014) defines intellectual humility in this way:

> Having a consciousness of the limits of one’s knowledge, including a sensitivity to circumstances in which one’s native egocentrism is likely to function self-deceptively; sensitivity to bias, prejudice, and limitations of one’s viewpoint. Intellectual humility depends on recognizing that one should not claim more than one actually knows. It does not imply spinelessness or submissiveness. It implies the lack of intellectual pretentiousness, boastfulness, or conceit, combined with insight into the logical foundations, or lack of such foundations, of one’s beliefs. ([Foundation for Critical Thinking, 2014](https://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/valuable-intellectual-traits/528){target="_blank"})

#### What is Intellectual Humility? {.unnumbered}

As humans, we tend to believe that we are correct about what we know and believe.

**What It Is**: Psychologists describe intellectual humility as recognizing the boundaries of your own knowledge and being open to learning from others (Porter & Schumann, 2018). Intellectual humility also means we are open to learning more, to changing our beliefs as we learn more.

Intellectual humility is different from self-doubt; rather, it combines confidence with curiosity. "People who lack self-confidence might doubt their beliefs not because they are intellectually humble but rather because they evaluate their knowledge or intellectual ability unfavorably" (Leary et al, 2017, p. 794). Instead, those who are intellectually humble demonstrate confidence in their intellectual abilities—but also understand that they do not know everything, and they may need more information, experience, or expertise to learn further.

> Intellectual humility is defined as recognizing that a particular personal belief may be fallible, accompanied by an appropriate attentiveness to limitations in the evidentiary basis of that belief and to one’s own limitations in obtaining and evaluating relevant information (Leary et al, 2017, p. 793).

In other words, intellectual humility is not simply being open to learning, but also seeking out that learning so we can become more certain of our beliefs and knowledge.

**What it means for us:** As teachers and learners, we can enter learning spaces and experiences with "a willingness to recognize the limits of one’s knowledge and appreciate others’ intellectual strengths" (Porter & Schumann, 2018, p. 140).

Intellectual humility allows us to enter our teaching and learning experience with the understanding that we have something to give and something to learn. With intellectual humility, we acknowledge that we always have something more to learn.

> Some people are generally inclined to view their opinions, beliefs, and positions as subject to further consideration – that is intellectually humble. Yet, even those individuals are likely to have certain views that they are unwilling, or at least unlikely, to reconsider even when confronted with evidence that they could be wrong (Hoyle et al., 2016, p. 165).

As Hoyle et al. (2016) note here, most of have some areas of our lives in which we are likely to be unmoved, even when presented with evidence that suggests our ideas or knowledge is not valid.

**Why It Matters for Adult Learners**: Adults arrive in classrooms with diverse professional, cultural, and personal experiences. When educators practice intellectual humility, they validate learners as co-contributors to knowledge. Intellectual humility promotes empathy, reduces polarization, and strengthens dialogue across differences. These qualities directly support the creation of inclusive and authentic learning communities.

Humans have a natural inclination to want to be considered knowledgeable. And, as teachers, facilitators, and leaders, that natural inclination can be even stronger. We might believe we *should* have the answers to questions that are asked, so that we should know more about a topic than we actually know.

> People with high intellectual humility might feel less motivated to defend their correctness and intellectual superiority because they are more comfortable acknowledging their intellectual fallibility. We therefore predict that intellectual humility will be associated with openness to learning about opposing perspectives, even during disagreements about highly charged topics (Porter & Schumann, 2017, p. 140).

**Funds of Knowledge:** As discussed previously, adult learners bring a vast variety of life experience, professional expertise, cultural understanding, social support, and prior educational knowledge into their learning experiences. They also bring with them what Moll et al. (1992) defines as *funds of knowledge. "*We use the term ‘funds of knowledge’ to refer to these historically accumulate and culturally developed bodies of knowledge and skills essential for household or individual functioning and well-being" (Moll et al., 1992, p. 133).

**Intellectual Humility in Practice:** As adult educators, we have the opportunity to facilitate learning from a place of intellectual humility, acknowledging the funds of knowledge our students bring with them into their learning. When we incorporate a servant leadership perspective with intellectual humility, we will seek to engage people’s heads, hearts and hopes and empower learners to turn their newfound knowledge and skills into action.

We encourage you to consider how you can infuse your role as teacher, facilitator, or leaders with a focus on the common good, seeking ways to engage confidently in contemporary cultural tensions. With students who are Christian, this perspective of the common good finds its roots and expression in a relationship with Jesus Christ. For students who are not of the Christian faith, strive to espouse this in word and example in a way that is respectful of their heritage and traditions while at the same time giving them an understanding of the Christian worldview. Take the time to listen to those you teach, learning from them what is important to them and seeking to understand their beliefs to build bridges of understanding through respect.

Dr. Adrienne Castellon, a former faculty member at Trinity Western University, shares these thoughts on how her core values influence her teaching:

> Realizing that our core values, personality traits, and characteristics impact how we learn and teach, take the time to discern your essential values. For example, I have identified the following six essential values to incorporate into my life and teaching: honesty, integrity, persistence, desire to learn, compassion/empathy and community. Because I value compassion/empathy and community, I put the learner first and design my curricula and methodologies to suit the learners in my class. Because I value persistence and the desire to learn, I don’t give up on students and I try to find ways to help them learn through different methods and alternate ways that they can demonstrate their learning.

These values direct my entire teaching methodology; I espouse the goals of differentiated instruction (basically changing instructional methods to adapt to different learners) and aim to create a space for learning that empowers all students to succeed. For more information, see ["Differentiated Instruction | Definition, Strategies & Examples"](https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-differentiated-instruction-examples-definition-activities.html){target="_blank"} (Study.com, n.d.) as a supplementary resource.

**Differentiated Instruction:** One way to demonstrate intellectual humility, is to acknowledge that we all learn differently. Differentiated instruction can become a seamless part of your instructional planning and practice. Differentiated instruction is a teaching approach in which you tailor your teaching and learning activities to meet the diverse needs of learners in your classroom or training session.

You can practice differentiated instruction by intentionally creating opportunities to learn about students’ strengths, needs, interests, preferences, and ways of learning. The online tool "[What’s Your Learning Style?](http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml){target="_blank"}" is an example of a self-assessment tool to help identify a learner’s learning style. To this end you can use meaningful strategies and ongoing assessment and adjustment. You can differentiate the content, process, or product components of the learning experience by using a range of strategies and methods, e.g., anchor activities, tiered lessons, small-group instruction, and varied tasks. Visit [Differentiated Instruction](https://lincs.ed.gov/state-resources/federal-initiatives/teal/guide/differentiatedinstruction){target="_blank"} (LINCS, n.d.) to learn more.

Please take the time to explore the resources linked in the notes and other resources in your Brookfield and Preskill (2016) and Silberman and Biech (2015) texts. The approach taken throughout this course is an intellectually humble one. In chapters five and six, Brookfield and Preskill (2016) particularly address the power dynamic in the classroom, awareness of which may foster a more intellectually humble approach. You are encouraged to use your texts as primary resources for more detailed information about specific strategies and approaches to contributing as an adult educator while remaining intellectually humble.

As you read this article, self-evaluate your level of openness, curiosity, tolerance of ambiguity and dogmatism.

In your reflective journal, consider:

- What two or three actions can you incorporate into your practice as an adult educator and leader to nurture your own intellectual humility and foster it in your students?

Consider the ways in which you might make assumptions about those you interact with—not just about who they are, but also about what they believe.

As you reflect on this talk, consider the following:

- What can you learn from Nasser’s (2019) experience with her coworker?
- How can you remain open to hearing others’ beliefs? How can you feel comfortable sharing your own?
- What can you learn from your colleagues, students, and teachers?
- How can you expand your community, so you encounter others who have different beliefs from you?
- What small questions can you ask to make more connections?
- How and where can you practice listening?

:::

### Activity: Reflection and Discussion {.unnumbered}

::: {.learning-activity time="75"}

As we finish this unit, let’s pause and turn inward. Self-awareness and intellectual humility are not only ideas to think about—they are also practices we can feel and live in our bodies.

**Personal reflection (choose one practice):** Take 10–15 minutes to engage in a quiet activity that helps you center yourself.

You might:

- Take a short walk outdoors, noticing what comes into awareness with each step.
- Brew a cup of tea or coffee, paying attention to the ritual of preparing and savoring it.
- Sit quietly and take three deep breaths, noticing the rhythm of your body.
- Sketch or doodle freely for a few minutes, letting your hand move without judgment.

As you engage in this reflective experience, hold in mind these questions:

- Who am I becoming as an educator?
- How can I hold both confidence and humility in this role?

**Share Your Insight:** After your reflection, in the learning community share:

- One insight you discovered about yourself through the practice
- How that insight might influence the contribution you want to make as an adult educator
- A way you plan to nurture intellectual humility in your teaching or learning environment

**Engage with Others:** Read the reflections of your peers. Notice what resonates with you or expands your perspective. Respond to at least two peers, practicing humility by naming what you learned from their insights or how their experience challenged or enriched your own.

*Note:* This activity serves as the discussion prompt for this unit. Share your response and connect with others in the Learning Community to deepen your understanding.

## Summary {.unnumbered}

In this unit, we have explored the inward dimensions of becoming authentic and effective adult educators. Teaching begins with self-awareness. By learning to know ourselves—our values, strengths, and limitations—we create the foundation to trust our own presence in the classroom. As Palmer (2017) explains, "we teach who we are" (p. 2), reminding us that authenticity and inner clarity are essential to building trust with learners. This self-trust enables us to engage learners with confidence and openness, even in moments of uncertainty.

Alongside self-knowledge, we also considered the practice of intellectual humility. For adult educators, intellectual humility is not about diminishing our own expertise, but about modeling curiosity, openness to new perspectives, and a willingness to learn from students as well as colleagues. This practice allows us to foster authentic relationships, strengthen trust in the learning community, and invite shared exploration rooted in respect and mutual growth.
